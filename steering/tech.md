## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Plugin host | Claude Code CLI | Latest |
| Skill definitions | Markdown (SKILL.md) | N/A |
| Automation runner | Node.js (ESM) | v24+ |
| Issue tracker | GitHub Issues + Projects | gh CLI |
| Automation runner | Node.js (sdlc-runner.mjs) | v24+ |

### External Services

| Service | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| GitHub API | Issue/PR management, branch creation | Via `gh` CLI; requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Console/Log | Status updates from SDLC runner | Via log files in `<tmpdir>/sdlc-logs/` |
| Claude API | Powers Claude Code sessions | Underlying LLM for all skills |

---

## Versioning

The `VERSION` file at the project root is the single source of truth for the current version. Stack-specific files are kept in sync via `/open-pr`.

| File | Path | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `plugins/nmg-sdlc/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `version` | Plugin manifest version |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `plugins[0].version` | Marketplace index — must match plugin.json |

### Version Bump Classification

The `/open-pr` skill and the `sdlc-runner.mjs` deterministic bump postcondition both read this table to classify version bumps. Modify this table to change the classification rules — no skill or script changes are needed.

| Label | Bump Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `bug` | patch | Bug fix — backwards-compatible |
| `enhancement` | minor | New feature — backwards-compatible |

**Default**: If an issue's labels do not match any row, the bump type is **minor**.

**Milestone completion override**: If the issue is the last open issue in its milestone, the bump type is overridden to **major** regardless of labels.

## Technical Constraints

### Performance

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Skill execution | Reasonable for task complexity | Skills are interactive; no hard time limits in manual mode |
| Runner step timeout | Per-step config (5–30 min) | Prevents runaway automation sessions |

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

This project MUST work on macOS, Windows, and Linux. All contributions must respect cross-platform constraints:

| Constraint | Guideline |
|------------|-----------|
| File paths | Use forward slashes or `path.join()` — never hardcode `\` or `/` separators |
| Line endings | Files should use LF (`\n`); configure `.gitattributes` if needed |
| Shell commands in skills | Use POSIX-compatible commands; avoid Bash-specific syntax (e.g., `[[ ]]`, `<<<`) |
| Scripts | Node.js scripts must use `node:path` for path manipulation, never string concatenation |
| Case sensitivity | Treat file paths as case-sensitive (Linux is case-sensitive, macOS/Windows are not by default) |
| Symlinks | Do not rely on symlinks for core functionality (Windows requires elevated privileges) |
| Environment variables | Use cross-platform approaches; document platform differences where unavoidable |
| Executable permissions | Document `chmod +x` requirements; Windows users may need alternative setup |

### Security

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| GitHub authentication | `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var or gh CLI auth |
| No secrets in code | Steering docs and specs committed to repo; no credentials |
| Plugin permissions | Declared in SKILL.md `allowedTools` sections |

---

## Claude Code Resource Development

**Before creating or modifying any Claude Code resource (skill, agent, hook, plugin manifest), review the official Claude Code documentation to ensure best practices are followed.**

### Skills (SKILL.md)

| Aspect | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| Frontmatter | Use YAML frontmatter for `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `context`, `user-invocable`, `disable-model-invocation`, `argument-hint` |
| Size | Keep under 500 lines — move detailed reference material to separate files |
| Arguments | Use `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder to capture user input |
| Supporting files | Place templates, examples, and scripts alongside SKILL.md in the skill directory |
| Dynamic context | Use `` !`command` `` syntax to inject shell output before Claude processes the skill |

### Agents (.md files)

| Aspect | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| Frontmatter | Use YAML frontmatter for `name`, `description`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `model`, `maxTurns`, `permissionMode` |
| Tool access | Grant only necessary tools — use `disallowedTools` to deny inherited ones |
| Focus | Each agent should excel at one specific task |
| Description | Write detailed descriptions — Claude uses them to decide when to delegate |

### Plugin Manifests

| Aspect | Best Practice |
|--------|---------------|
| plugin.json location | Only `plugin.json` goes inside `.claude-plugin/` — all other components at plugin root |
| Component paths | Must be relative, starting with `./` (no absolute or traversing paths) |
| Versioning | Semver (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH); update both `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` |
| Testing | Use `claude --plugin-dir ./my-plugin` during development |

## Coding Standards

### Markdown (Skills, Templates, Steering)

```markdown
# GOOD patterns
- Use ATX-style headings (# not ===)
- Tables for structured data
- Code blocks with language hints
- Clear section hierarchy: H1 > H2 > H3
- TODO comments with <!-- TODO: --> for user-customizable sections

# BAD patterns
- Inline HTML (except comments)
- Deeply nested lists (prefer tables)
- Ambiguous placeholder text
```

### JavaScript (Runner Scripts)

```javascript
// GOOD patterns
- ESM imports (import/from)
- Node.js built-in modules (node:child_process, node:fs, node:path)
- parseArgs for CLI argument parsing
- JSDoc comments for script headers
- Explicit error handling with process.exit codes

// BAD patterns
- CommonJS require()
- External npm dependencies (scripts must be zero-dependency)
- Synchronous I/O in hot paths
```

### JSON (Plugin Manifests, Config)

```json
// GOOD patterns
- Consistent 2-space indentation
- Descriptive field names (camelCase)
- Version strings following semver

// BAD patterns
- Trailing commas
- Comments (not valid JSON)
- Deeply nested structures
```

---

## API / Interface Standards

### Plugin Interface

Skills are defined as Markdown files (`SKILL.md`) with:
- Workflow steps (numbered, imperative)
- `allowedTools` sections listing permitted tool patterns
- Integration with SDLC Workflow section
- Unattended-mode conditionals for headless operation

### GitHub CLI (`gh`)

```bash
# Issue operations
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels
gh issue develop <number> --checkout
gh issue comment <number> --body "..."

# PR operations
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."
gh pr checks <number>
gh pr merge <number> --merge
```

---

## Database Standards

<!-- Pre-fill if database conventions are discoverable -->

### Naming

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Tables | [convention] | [example] |
| Columns | [convention] | [example] |
| Primary keys | [convention] | [example] |

---

## Testing Standards

### Core Principle: Exercise-Based Verification

**This project is a Claude Code plugin. Skills are Markdown instructions, not executable code. The only way to verify a skill change is to exercise it in Claude Code.**

Traditional test frameworks (Jest, pytest, etc.) apply only to the SDLC runner script. For everything else — skills, agents, templates — verification means loading the plugin and running the skill against a real or test project.

### BDD Testing

**Every acceptance criterion MUST have a Gherkin test.**

| Layer | Framework | Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| BDD specs | Gherkin feature files | `specs/{feature-name}/feature.gherkin` |
| Runner tests | Jest (ESM) | `scripts/__tests__/` |

Gherkin specs serve as **design artifacts and verification criteria** — they define the expected behavior that exercise-based testing validates.

```gherkin
# specs/{feature-name}/feature.gherkin
Feature: [Feature name from issue title]
  As a [developer/automation agent]
  I want [capability]
  So that [benefit]

  Scenario: [Acceptance criterion]
    Given [precondition]
    When [action]
    Then [expected outcome]
```

### Plugin Exercise Testing

#### Loading the Plugin for Development

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/nmg-sdlc
```

Then invoke each changed skill directly (e.g., `/nmg-sdlc:write-spec #42`) and verify:
- The skill loads without errors
- Workflow steps execute in the expected order
- Output artifacts (files, GitHub comments, PR bodies) match downstream skill expectations
- Interactive gates appear in manual mode (or are skipped when `.claude/unattended-mode` exists)

#### Test Project Pattern

When verifying SDLC skill changes, exercise them against a **disposable test project** — not the nmg-plugins repo itself:

1. **Scaffold** a temporary project directory with minimal structure:
   - `README.md`, a basic source file, and `.gitignore`
   - `steering/` with minimal `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
   - Initialized git repo (`git init`) for branch/commit operations
   - A GitHub repo if the skill under test needs issue/PR operations (or use dry-run evaluation — see below)
2. **Load** the modified plugin: `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/nmg-sdlc --project-dir /path/to/test-project`
3. **Exercise** the changed skill against the test project
4. **Evaluate** the output against the spec's acceptance criteria
5. **Clean up** the test project after verification

#### Dry-Run Evaluation for GitHub-Integrated Skills

For skills that create GitHub resources (`/draft-issue`, `/open-pr`, `/start-issue`):

| Instead of... | Do this... |
|---------------|------------|
| Creating a real GitHub issue | Generate the issue title, body, and labels; evaluate the content against ACs |
| Creating a real PR | Generate the PR title, body, and branch diff; evaluate completeness |
| Setting issue status | Verify the `gh` commands that WOULD be invoked are correctly formed |

This avoids polluting real repositories during verification while still validating that the skill produces correct output. **The content and structure of what the skill would create is the testable artifact.**

#### Automated Exercise Testing via Agent SDK

Skills that use `AskUserQuestion` cannot be tested via raw `claude -p` — there's no TTY to respond to interactive prompts. The **Claude Agent SDK** solves this with the `canUseTool` callback, which intercepts `AskUserQuestion` and provides programmatic answers:

```typescript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "/nmg-sdlc:skill-name arguments",
  options: {
    plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "./plugins/nmg-sdlc" }],
    cwd: "/path/to/test-project",
    canUseTool: async (toolName, input) => {
      if (toolName === "AskUserQuestion") {
        // Auto-select first option for each question (deterministic)
        const answers = {};
        for (const q of input.questions) {
          answers[q.question] = q.options[0].label;
        }
        return { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: { ...input, answers } };
      }
      return { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: input };
    }
  }
})) {
  // Capture and evaluate output
}
```

**Promptfoo** wraps this into a declarative eval framework with built-in `AskUserQuestion` handling:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: anthropic:claude-agent-sdk
    config:
      plugins:
        - type: local
          path: ./plugins/nmg-sdlc
      ask_user_question:
        behavior: first_option  # deterministic: always picks first option
      max_budget_usd: 1.00
```

Three `ask_user_question` behaviors: `first_option` (deterministic), `random` (diversity testing), `deny` (test fallback paths).

#### Simpler Fallback: `claude -p` with Denied Questions

For quick smoke tests where `AskUserQuestion` handling isn't needed, deny the tool entirely and provide context upfront:

```bash
claude -p "Exercise the skill: /nmg-sdlc:skill-name args" \
  --plugin-dir ./plugins/nmg-sdlc \
  --project-dir /path/to/test-project \
  --disallowedTools AskUserQuestion \
  --append-system-prompt "Make reasonable default choices. Do not ask questions."
```

This tests the "no-questions" execution path only. Use the Agent SDK approach for full interactive path testing.

### Validation Approach Summary

| Type | Method | Applies To | AskUserQuestion |
|------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Agent SDK exercise testing | `canUseTool` callback with programmatic answers | Skills with interactive gates | Full support — answers provided programmatically |
| Promptfoo eval suite | Declarative YAML test cases with `ask_user_question` config | Skills, agents, templates | `first_option`, `random`, or `deny` modes |
| Smoke test (`claude -p`) | `--disallowedTools AskUserQuestion` | Quick verification | Denied — tests fallback path only |
| Spec verification | `/verify-code` skill — behavioral contract checking | All changes | N/A |
| Architecture review | `architecture-reviewer` agent — 5 checklists scored 1–5 | Code structure, scripts | N/A |
| Runner unit tests | Jest (`npm test` in `scripts/`) | `sdlc-runner.mjs` | N/A |
| Structural validation | Verify `plugin.json`/`marketplace.json` schema, file existence | Plugin manifests | N/A |
| Prompt quality review | Unambiguous instructions, complete workflow paths, correct tool references | SKILL.md files | N/A |

## Verification Strategy — Behavioral Contracts

This project is prompt-based: skills are Markdown instructions that Claude Code executes. Traditional code quality metrics (test coverage, cyclomatic complexity) don't apply to most of the codebase. Instead, verification uses **Design by Contract** — each skill and component has preconditions, postconditions, invariants, and behavioral boundaries that `/verify-code` checks.

### Self-Verification (Dogfooding)

This project develops the SDLC toolkit itself. When `/verify-code` runs for changes to SDLC skills, it MUST go beyond static analysis:

1. **Read the changed skill** — verify prompt quality (unambiguous, complete, correct tool refs)
2. **Check behavioral contracts** — preconditions, postconditions, invariants per the tables below
3. **Exercise the skill** — if feasible within the verification session, load the plugin and invoke the changed skill against a test project (see Testing Standards → Test Project Pattern)
4. **Evaluate output** — for GitHub-integrated skills, evaluate what WOULD be created rather than creating real artifacts (see Testing Standards → Dry-Run Evaluation)

If exercise testing is not feasible during automated verification (time or tool constraints), `/verify-code` should explicitly note this in the verification report and recommend manual exercise testing as a follow-up.

### Contract Framework

| Contract Type | Question It Answers |
|---------------|-------------------|
| **Preconditions** | What must be true before the skill/component runs? |
| **Postconditions** | What must be true after successful execution? |
| **Invariants** | What must remain true throughout execution? |
| **Behavioral boundaries** | What must the skill/component NOT do? |

### Skill-Level Contracts

Every skill has implicit contracts. When verifying a skill change, check:

#### Preconditions (Step 0 / Prerequisites)
- Required files exist (specs, steering docs, issues)
- Required tools are available (`gh` CLI, git)
- Correct branch / working directory state

#### Postconditions (Step N / Output)
- Output files created in the correct location and format
- GitHub issue/PR updated with expected content
- No orphaned files or partial state left behind
- Downstream skills can consume the output (e.g., `/write-spec` output feeds `/write-code`)

#### Invariants (Throughout Execution)
- Stack-agnostic: no project-specific technology hardcoded in skill instructions
- Steering docs used as the abstraction layer for project-specific details
- Unattended-mode gates: interactive prompts present unless `.claude/unattended-mode` exists
- Cross-platform: no platform-specific paths, commands, or assumptions

#### Behavioral Boundaries
- Skills must not modify files outside their declared scope
- Skills must not commit, push, or merge unless that is their explicit purpose
- Skills must not skip interactive gates in manual mode
- Skills must not introduce dependencies on external services not declared in tech.md

### Checklist Applicability

The architecture-reviewer checklists were designed for runtime codebases. Apply them to nmg-plugins with these adjustments:

| Checklist | Applies To | Skip For | Reinterpretation |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| SOLID | Scripts (sdlc-runner.mjs) | Markdown skills | For skills: SRP = one skill does one workflow step; DIP = skills reference steering docs, not hardcoded details |
| Security | Scripts | Markdown templates | Focus: no secrets in committed files, safe `gh` CLI patterns, no shell injection in skill commands |
| Performance | Runner script | Skills, templates | Focus: runner timeouts configured, no blocking operations |
| Testability | All — reinterpret | N/A | For skills: steps can be followed manually with predictable results; scenarios are independent; templates produce valid output |
| Error Handling | Scripts | Markdown skills | Focus: runner exit codes, graceful failures with meaningful stderr |

### Prompt Quality Verification

For Markdown skills, the "code quality" equivalent is prompt quality:

| Criterion | What to Check |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Unambiguous instructions** | Each step has one clear interpretation; no room for Claude to guess |
| **Complete workflow paths** | Happy path, error/edge cases, and unattended mode all covered |
| **Correct tool references** | Skills name the right tools (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep` — not `cat`, `find`, `grep`) |
| **Logical step ordering** | Dependencies flow forward; no step references information from a later step |
| **Gate integrity** | Decision points have `AskUserQuestion` (or unattended-mode bypass) |
| **Template-output chain** | Output format matches what downstream skills expect as input |
| **Cross-reference validity** | Links to templates, checklists, and other skills resolve correctly |

### Script Verification

For `sdlc-runner.mjs` and other runtime scripts:

| Contract | Check |
|----------|-------|
| Preconditions | Required env vars documented; input validation at entry point |
| Postconditions | Non-zero exit on failure; meaningful stdout/stderr; no partial state on error |
| Invariants | Zero external dependencies (`node:*` only); cross-platform paths via `node:path` |
| Boundaries | No network calls beyond declared services; idempotent re-runs |
