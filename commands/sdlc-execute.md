# Execute

Automated orchestrator. Runs only in the main Herdr pane. Never edits product code, never implements tasks, never opens PRs. Delegates all work to sibling Herdr `--kind omp` workers.

## Preflight

`HERDR_ENV` must be exactly `1`. `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` and `HERDR_PANE_ID` must be set. If any is missing, print that execute requires a Herdr OMP session and stop with no mutations.

## Execution

Trim `$ARGUMENTS`. Non-empty: invoke `node scripts/sdlc-execute.mjs run` with the trimmed tokens. Empty: read `references/selection.md` and follow it, then invoke `run` only with the selected tokens.

Pass stdout and stderr through unchanged. Exit with the controller exit code.

Do not edit product code, implement tasks, or open PRs in this pane. Never run `herdr server stop`. Never pass `--kind pi`.
