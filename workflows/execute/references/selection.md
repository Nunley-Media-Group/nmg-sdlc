# Select specified issues

Read only when `/sdlc-execute` receives empty arguments.

1. Run `node <plugin-root>/scripts/sdlc-execute.mjs list-specified`.
2. If `ok` is false, print the helper output and stop without invoking `run`.
3. If `issues` is empty, print exactly `No open spec-created issues.` and stop without invoking `run`.
4. Otherwise use one built-in `ask` with `multi: true`. Do not set `recommended`. The question lists every returned issue, one per line as `#N — {title}`, followed by `Which spec-created issues should /sdlc-execute run?`
5. Offer the four lowest-numbered issues as `#N — {title}` issue chips, or every issue when fewer than four exist. There is no Cancel chip. Continue is the built-in confirm action. Automatic Other accepts `#N`, `N`, or comma- or whitespace-separated lists under the controller's token rules.
6. Union selected chips with Other tokens: chips in ascending displayed order, then Other tokens in typed order; dedupe first occurrence first. Invalid Other or an empty union reopens the same question. A non-empty union starts immediately with no second confirmation.
7. Invoke `node <plugin-root>/scripts/sdlc-execute.mjs run` once with the selected numbers as separate `#N` tokens in the resolved order.
8. If the built-in question UI is unavailable, print `Run /sdlc-execute in the TUI to choose spec-created issues.` followed by every `list-specified` title, then stop without invoking `run`.
