description: "Orchestrate automated delivery for approved, spec-created issues through Herdr OMP worker sessions. Use when the user says execute, ship specified issues, /sdlc-execute, or passes comma- or whitespace-separated issue numbers to deliver. With no numbers, resume the exact current branch's incomplete run before offering issue selection. Do NOT use to draft issues or write specs."

# Execute

Automated orchestrator. Runs only in the main Herdr pane. Never edits product code, never implements tasks, never opens PRs. Delegates all work to sibling Herdr `--kind omp` workers.

## Preflight

`HERDR_ENV` must be exactly `1`. `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` and `HERDR_PANE_ID` must be set. If any is missing, print that execute requires a Herdr OMP session and stop with no mutations.

## Execution

Trim `$ARGUMENTS`. Accept `--retain-worker` and `--recover-stale` at most once each among issue tokens; absent `--retain-worker` means the controller closes its owned worker panes on every terminal stop or cancellation. Decide whether issue tokens remain after removing both flags. With issue tokens, invoke `node "<plugin-root>/scripts/sdlc-execute.mjs" run` with every trimmed token. With no issue tokens, execute the packaged `# Select specified issues` section from `workflows/execute/references/selection.md`: discover exact-branch recovery before any picker. Read that package-root reference if the section is not already inlined. Never translate a discovered queue into explicit issue arguments; the bare `run` invocation owns recovery authorization.

Bare recovery preserves the persisted queue, completed stages and prior failure history. It may reclaim only proven stale ownership and consume one durable recovery allowance per exhausted run/issue/step before dispatch. Explicit queues and `--recover-stale` with an explicit queue never grant that allowance. A failed, ambiguous or lost recovery cannot replay or start automatic follow-on repair; commits, changed summaries and plugin upgrades do not replenish it. A validated passed handoff may settle and continue every remaining review, verification and exact-head delivery gate. Never bypass intervention, branch or ownership blockers.

Only a parameter-free invocation grants the one-time exhausted recovery allowance. Optional flags may retain their existing resume or ownership behavior, but neither `--recover-stale` alone nor `--retain-worker` grants fresh repair work.

A failed `implement` intervention may enter that same one-time bare recovery only as a proven repaired-publication state. Require the run, strict handoff, exact current HEAD, actual branch, run-bound unique incomplete owner and current read-only owner-bound probe to agree; permit only the probe's explicit stale run-branch discrepancy. The combined tracked diff from run HEAD must be one unstaged singular Approved `tasks.md`, and the package-scoped detector must prove one or more selected `Files` to `File(s)` label-only changes with every other byte preserved and current detection converged to zero. No allowed implementation path may be modified, staged or untracked; no controller lock or prior recovery record may exist. Preserve untracked goal-ledger failure evidence only when the complete bounded regular-file terminal-session ownership contract validates; never infer permission from `.pi-glla`, another basename, ignore rules, or prose alone.

Discovery is read-only. Parameter-free bare `run` must repeat the complete proof after acquiring its own lease, consume `repaired_publication_intervention` through the existing durable owner, append the existing checkpoint recovery tuple by CAS, retain the failed handoff in recovery evidence/history, and dispatch only the implement remediation. Any mismatch remains the original intervention blocker. A consumed, failed, cancelled, ambiguous or lost dispatch is never offered again.

Current reviews use controller-owned per-slice snapshots and host receipts, not
unbounded nested review agents. A proven contamination consumes one replacement
for the whole review stage; missing proof, empty output, or a failed replacement
stops without replenishing remediation. Original review evidence stays intact.
Publication helpers reconcile a failed first push before their terminal handoff.
After safe base reconciliation, handle `mergeability_reverification_required`
before generic remediation: preserve stale evidence, invalidate every
review/fix/verify completion, and rerun those gates under the same recovery owner.
Do not mint allowances from the new head or alter existing exhausted-run records.

Pass stdout and stderr through unchanged. Exit with the controller exit code.

Do not edit product code, implement tasks, or open PRs in this pane. Never run `herdr server stop`. Never pass `--kind pi`.
