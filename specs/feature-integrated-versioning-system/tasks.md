- [ ] [Verifiable criterion 2]

**Notes**: [Optional implementation hints]
```

Map `{layer}/` placeholders to actual project paths using `structure.md`.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### T001: Add Versioning Section to Tech.md Steering Template

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/setup-steering/templates/tech.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New `## Versioning` section exists after Technology Stack, before Technical Constraints
- [ ] Section includes explanatory text about the `VERSION` file as single source of truth
- [ ] Section includes a table for declaring stack-specific version file mappings (File | Path | Notes)
- [ ] Path Syntax subsection documents dot-notation for JSON/TOML files
- [ ] Section has `<!-- TODO: -->` placeholder rows consistent with existing template style
- [ ] Existing template content is unchanged

**Notes**: See design.md §3 for the exact section content. Follow the existing template's pattern of `<!-- TODO: -->` comments for user-customizable sections.

### T002: Create VERSION File for nmg-plugins Repository

**File(s)**: `VERSION` (project root)
**Type**: Create
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] `VERSION` file exists at project root
- [ ] Contains the current nmg-sdlc plugin version (read from `plugins/nmg-sdlc/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`)
- [ ] File is plain text, single line, no trailing newline beyond what's standard
- [ ] Version string is valid semver (X.Y.Z)

**Notes**: Read the current version from `plugin.json` to seed the file. This repository will now use the integrated versioning system it provides.

---

## Phase 2: Skill Modifications

### T003: Add Milestone Assignment to `/draft-issue`

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/draft-issue/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New Step 2b "Assign Milestone" exists after type classification (Step 2), before investigation (Step 3)
- [ ] Step reads `VERSION` file to derive current major version as milestone default
- [ ] Handles missing `VERSION` file gracefully (defaults to "v0" or skips milestone)
- [ ] Manual mode: uses `interactive prompt` to present milestone options (default + custom number)
- [ ] Accepts a single number input (e.g., "3") and normalizes to "v2"
- [ ] Checks for existing milestone via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones`
- [ ] Creates milestone via `gh api --method POST` if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Passes milestone to `gh issue create` via `--milestone` flag in Step 7
- [ ] Unattended-mode: defaults to current major version milestone without prompting
- [ ] Subsequent step numbers are renumbered to account for the insertion
- [ ] Existing skill functionality is preserved

**Notes**: See design.md §1 for detailed logic. The milestone query should use `gh api` not `gh milestone` (which doesn't exist).

### T004: Add Version Bump Classification to `/open-pr`

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/open-pr/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New Step 1b "Determine Version Bump" exists after context reading (Step 1), before PR content generation (Step 2)
- [ ] Checks for `VERSION` file existence; skips all versioning if absent
- [ ] Reads current version from `VERSION` file
- [ ] Reads issue labels via `gh issue view #N --json labels`
- [ ] Applies classification matrix: `bug` → patch, `enhancement` → minor, default → minor
- [ ] Calculates new version string (patch: x.y.Z+1, minor: x.Y+1.0)
- [ ] Major bumps are available only via manual override in the confirmation prompt
- [ ] Manual mode: presents classification to developer via `interactive prompt` with override options (Accept / Patch / Minor / Major)
- [ ] Unattended-mode: applies classified bump without confirmation

**Notes**: See design.md §2 Step 1b. Major bumps are manual-only — the developer overrides via the confirmation prompt.

### T005: Add Version Artifact Updates to `/open-pr`

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/open-pr/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T004
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New Step 1c "Update Version Artifacts" exists after version bump classification (Step 1b)
- [ ] Writes new version string to `VERSION` file
- [ ] Updates `CHANGELOG.md`: moves `[Unreleased]` content under new `## [{version}] - {YYYY-MM-DD}` heading
- [ ] Leaves `[Unreleased]` section empty after moving content
- [ ] Reads `steering/tech.md` for `## Versioning` section
- [ ] If Versioning section exists: parses table rows for file:path mappings
- [ ] Updates each declared stack-specific version file at the specified path
- [ ] If no Versioning section or empty table: skips stack-specific updates
- [ ] All version file changes are staged before PR creation
- [ ] PR body includes a "Version" note showing the bump type and new version
- [ ] Handles missing `CHANGELOG.md` gracefully (creates minimal one with the version heading)

**Notes**: See design.md §2 Step 1c. The CHANGELOG update must preserve existing content — only structural changes (moving [Unreleased] entries to versioned heading).

### T006: Add CHANGELOG Analysis to `/migrate-project`

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New Step 6b "Analyze CHANGELOG.md" exists after existing Step 6, before Step 7 (Present Findings)
- [ ] If no `CHANGELOG.md` exists: generates one from git history
  - [ ] Parses conventional commits (`git log --pretty=format:"%H|%s"`)
  - [ ] Reads git tags (`git tag --sort=version:refname`)
  - [ ] Groups commits by tag boundaries
  - [ ] Categorizes by type: `feat:` → Added, `fix:` → Fixed, `chore:/refactor:/build:` → Changed
  - [ ] If no tags: groups all under `[0.1.0]`
  - [ ] Includes `[Unreleased]` section for commits after latest tag
  - [ ] Uses Keep a Changelog preamble
- [ ] If `CHANGELOG.md` exists: reconciles with git history
  - [ ] Checks for `[Unreleased]` section, adds if missing
  - [ ] Checks for version headings matching git tags, adds missing ones
  - [ ] Restructures entries into `### Added / ### Changed / ### Fixed` categories if flat
  - [ ] Preserves manually-written entries that don't map to commits
  - [ ] Adds Keep a Changelog preamble if missing
- [ ] Records all changes as pending for Step 7 (Present Findings)
- [ ] Existing migration functionality is preserved

**Notes**: See design.md §4 Step 6b. The reconciliation logic should be additive — never delete existing content, only restructure and fill gaps.

### T007: Add VERSION Analysis to `/migrate-project`

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T006
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New Step 6c "Analyze VERSION File" exists after Step 6b (CHANGELOG analysis)
- [ ] Derives expected version from: (1) latest versioned CHANGELOG heading, (2) latest git tag, or (3) `0.1.0` default
- [ ] If no `VERSION` file: records "create VERSION with {version}" as pending
- [ ] If `VERSION` exists but doesn't match: records "update VERSION from {current} to {expected}" as pending
- [ ] If `VERSION` exists and matches: records "VERSION is up to date" (no change)
- [ ] Pending changes presented in Step 7 alongside other findings
- [ ] Applied in Step 8 using Write tool

**Notes**: See design.md §4 Step 6c. VERSION is always derived from the CHANGELOG output of Step 6b, so this step must run after CHANGELOG analysis.

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

*N/A — nmg-plugins is a prompt-based plugin repository with no frontend components.*

---

## Phase 4: Integration

### T008: Update nmg-plugins Steering Tech.md with Versioning Section

**File(s)**: `steering/tech.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T001
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] `## Versioning` section added to this project's `tech.md`
- [ ] Table declares stack-specific version files for this repo:
  - `plugins/nmg-sdlc/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
  - `.codex-plugin/marketplace.json` → `plugins[0].version`
- [ ] Section follows the same format as the template from T001
- [ ] Existing `tech.md` content is unchanged

**Notes**: This makes nmg-plugins itself use the versioning system — `/open-pr` will read this section to update `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` automatically when bumping versions.

### T009: Update README.md with Versioning Documentation

**File(s)**: `README.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T003, T004, T005, T006, T007
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Versioning system documented as a feature/capability
- [ ] Explains `VERSION` file as single source of truth
- [ ] Documents the version classification matrix (bug→patch, enhancement→minor, default→minor; major is manual)
- [ ] Documents the `tech.md` Versioning section as the stack-specific bridge
- [ ] Documents milestone assignment in `/draft-issue`
- [ ] Updated skill descriptions reflect new versioning capabilities
- [ ] Existing README structure and content preserved

**Notes**: README is the primary public documentation. The versioning system changes user-facing behavior of 3 skills and adds a new concept (VERSION file), so README must be updated.

### T010: Update CHANGELOG.md

**File(s)**: `CHANGELOG.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T003, T004, T005, T006, T007, T008
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] `[Unreleased]` section has entries for all changes in this feature
- [ ] Entries categorized under `### Added` (new versioning capabilities) and `### Changed` (modified skills)
- [ ] Entries are concise and user-facing (describe capabilities, not implementation details)
- [ ] Existing CHANGELOG content preserved

---

## Phase 5: BDD Testing

### T011: Create BDD Feature File

**File(s)**: `specs/41-integrated-versioning-system/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Create
**Depends**: T003, T004, T005, T006, T007
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] All 11 acceptance criteria (AC1, AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6, AC7, AC8a, AC8b, AC9, AC10) have corresponding scenarios
- [ ] Uses Given/When/Then format consistently
- [ ] Scenarios are independent and self-contained
- [ ] Includes happy path, alternative paths, and edge cases
- [ ] Valid Gherkin syntax
- [ ] Feature description matches the user story

---

## Phase 6: Classification Deduplication — Issue #87

### T012: Add Version Bump Classification Subsection to Tech.md Steering Template

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/setup-steering/templates/tech.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T001
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New `### Version Bump Classification` subsection exists under `## Versioning`, after the Path Syntax subsection
- [ ] Subsection includes introductory text explaining that both `/open-pr` and `sdlc-runner.mjs` read this table
- [ ] Table has three columns: Label | Bump Type | Description
- [ ] Default rows include `bug` → `patch` and `enhancement` → `minor`
- [ ] Documents the default behavior: "if no label matches, bump type is minor"
- [ ] Documents that major bumps are manual-only via developer override
- [ ] Has `<!-- TODO: -->` placeholder consistent with existing template style
- [ ] Existing template content is unchanged

**Notes**: See design.md "Classification Matrix Deduplication" section for the exact content. This extends the existing Versioning section that was added in T001.

### T013: Add Version Bump Classification to nmg-plugins Project Tech.md

**File(s)**: `steering/tech.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T012
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] `### Version Bump Classification` subsection exists under `## Versioning`
- [ ] Table contains the default rows: `bug` → `patch`, `enhancement` → `minor`
- [ ] Default behavior and milestone override are documented
- [ ] Follows the same format as the template from T012
- [ ] Existing `tech.md` content is unchanged

**Notes**: This makes the nmg-plugins project itself use the shared classification matrix. Both `/open-pr` and `sdlc-runner.mjs` will read this when running against this repo.

### T014: Update `/open-pr` to Read Classification from Tech.md

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/open-pr/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T012
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Step 2 item 3 ("Apply the classification matrix") no longer contains an inline table
- [ ] Instead, Step 2 item 3 instructs Codex to read `steering/tech.md`, find the `## Versioning` section, then the `### Version Bump Classification` subsection, and parse the table
- [ ] The instruction specifies: match issue labels against the Label column, use the corresponding Bump Type
- [ ] Documents the fallback: if the subsection is missing, default to `bug` → patch, everything else → minor
- [ ] The milestone completion override (Step 2 item 4) remains unchanged
- [ ] Version calculation, user confirmation, and unattended-mode behavior are unchanged
- [ ] Existing skill functionality beyond classification lookup is preserved

**Notes**: See design.md "Consumer Changes §1" for the updated step text. The key change is replacing 3 lines of inline table with a reference to the steering document.

### T015: Update `sdlc-runner.mjs` to Read Classification from Tech.md

**File(s)**: `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T012
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] `performDeterministicVersionBump()` no longer contains hardcoded label→bump if-else logic (lines ~1487-1496)
- [ ] Instead, it reads `steering/tech.md`, extracts the `### Version Bump Classification` subsection, and parses the table rows
- [ ] Table parsing reuses the same row-parsing pattern already used for stack-specific file mappings (split by `|`, trim, filter)
- [ ] Builds a `Map<string, string>` (or equivalent) of label → bump type from parsed rows
- [ ] Matches issue labels against the map; first match wins
- [ ] Default to minor if no label matches any row
- [ ] Major bumps are not applied automatically — only patch and minor
- [ ] Fallback: if the Version Bump Classification subsection is missing from tech.md, uses hardcoded defaults (`bug` → patch, else → minor)
- [ ] Existing `performDeterministicVersionBump()` functionality beyond classification (VERSION file reading, stack-specific file updates, commit, push) is unchanged
- [ ] Runner tests in `scripts/__tests__/` are updated to cover the new parsing logic

**Notes**: See design.md "Consumer Changes §2". The regex to extract the subsection can be chained from the existing `## Versioning` extraction at line 1529. Parse only within that captured section for the `### Version Bump Classification` heading.

### T016: Update BDD Feature File with Classification Deduplication Scenarios

**File(s)**: `specs/feature-integrated-versioning-system/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T012, T014, T015
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Three new scenarios corresponding to AC11, AC12, AC13 are appended
- [ ] New scenarios are tagged with a comment `# Added by issue #87`
- [ ] Scenarios use Given/When/Then format consistently
- [ ] Existing scenarios are unchanged
- [ ] Valid Gherkin syntax

---

## Phase 7: Manual-Only Major Version Policy — Issue #139

### T017: Remove Milestone Override and Add `--major` Flag to `/open-pr`

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/open-pr/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T014
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Frontmatter `usage hint` is `[#issue-number] [--major]`
- [ ] A new argument-parsing sub-step before Step 2 inspects invocation args and sets a `major_requested` flag when `--major` is present
- [ ] If `.codex/unattended-mode` exists AND `major_requested` is true, the skill prints exactly `ESCALATION: --major flag requires human confirmation — unattended mode cannot apply a major version bump` and exits immediately (no VERSION/CHANGELOG/stack-file writes, no PR)
- [ ] Step 2.4 ("Check milestone completion") is deleted entirely — no `gh api ... open_issues` query, no major override
- [ ] Step 2 "Calculate new version" honors `major_requested` (bumps major instead of the classified type) when set
- [ ] Step 2 confirmation menu (`interactive prompt`) pre-selects Major as the recommended option when `major_requested` is set; still offers Patch / Minor / Major alternatives
- [ ] Step 2 confirmation menu behavior is unchanged when `--major` is not supplied (classified type remains recommended)
- [ ] Unattended-mode path without `--major` is unchanged — still applies classified bump silently
- [ ] Subsequent step numbering remains consistent; any internal references to the deleted milestone step are removed

**Notes**: See design.md "Manual-Only Major Version Policy Enforcement (Issue #139)" for the exact logic and the updated data flow. The existing Step 2 items 1–3 (read VERSION, read labels, read classification matrix) are unchanged. This task supersedes the earlier T014 note that "milestone completion override (Step 2 item 4) remains unchanged" — that note reflected the issue #87 scope only.

### T018: Rewrite Breaking-Change Guidance in `steering/tech.md`

**File(s)**: `steering/tech.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T013
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] The paragraph `**Milestone completion override**: If the issue is the last open issue in its milestone, the bump type is overridden to **major** regardless of labels.` is removed from the `### Version Bump Classification` subsection
- [ ] A replacement paragraph states `**Major bumps are manual-only.**` and explains that they are never triggered by labels, milestones, or breaking changes; the only path is `/open-pr #N --major`; the runner will not apply major bumps; unattended mode escalates on `--major`
- [ ] A second replacement paragraph states `**Breaking changes use minor bumps.**` and describes the `**BREAKING CHANGE:**` bullet prefix convention plus the recommended `### Migration Notes` sub-section, with a short inline markdown example
- [ ] Wording matches the design.md snippet verbatim (or is semantically equivalent if minor formatting adjustments are needed)
- [ ] No other content in `tech.md` is modified
- [ ] Document renders without markdown syntax errors

### T019: Apply Same Rewrite to Onboard-Project Template

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/onboard-project/templates/tech.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T012
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] The `**Milestone completion override**` paragraph is removed from the template's `### Version Bump Classification` subsection
- [ ] The same two replacement paragraphs from T018 appear in the template with identical wording, so that newly onboarded projects inherit the corrected policy
- [ ] Template `<!-- TODO: -->` placeholders and example rows are preserved
- [ ] No other template content is modified

### T020: Audit README.md for Stale Milestone-Completion References

**File(s)**: `README.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] No row in any version-bump-type table references milestone completion
- [ ] The `/open-pr` skill description documents only label-based classification with `--major` as the manual opt-in for major bumps
- [ ] Any text describing the argument hint for `/open-pr` shows `[#issue-number] [--major]`
- [ ] If the README is already clean (commit `ac7bab1` removed most of this language), the task closes with a note confirming no further change is required
- [ ] No unrelated README edits

**Notes**: Commit `ac7bab1` already dropped the milestone-completion row from the bump-type table and rewrote the `/open-pr` description. This task is an explicit audit to guarantee no stragglers remain (e.g., usage hint language in skill overview sections).

### T021: Append Issue #139 Scenarios to BDD Feature File

**File(s)**: `specs/feature-integrated-versioning-system/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T017, T018, T019
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Five new scenarios corresponding to AC14, AC15, AC16, AC17, AC18 are appended
- [ ] Each new scenario is tagged with a comment `# Added by issue #139`
- [ ] Scenarios use Given/When/Then format consistently
- [ ] Existing scenarios (including the issue #87 additions) are unchanged
- [ ] Valid Gherkin syntax
