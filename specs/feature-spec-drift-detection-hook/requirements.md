# Requirements: Spec Drift Detection Hook

**Issues**: #9
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Codex (retroactive)

---

## User Story

**As a** developer working on a codebase with active specs,
**I want** automatic detection when my file modifications drift from existing specifications,
**So that** I catch unintended spec violations in real-time rather than discovering them during verification.

---

## Background

The spec alignment PostToolUse hook fires on every `Write` and `Edit` tool call, checking whether the file modification is consistent with all active specs in `specs/`. The hook intentionally checks ALL specs — not just the spec for the current branch — ensuring that any file change, even outside the SDLC workflow, is validated against every existing specification. Originally a `prompt`-type hook, it was upgraded to an `agent`-type hook so it can read spec files when checking for drift. A `command`-type gate was added that short-circuits when no spec files exist, avoiding expensive agent spawns on every Write/Edit in projects without specs.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Drift Detected on File Edit

**Given** specs exist in `specs/`
**When** I edit a file that conflicts with a spec's requirements
**Then** the hook flags the drift with an explanation of which spec requirement is violated

### AC2: All Specs Are Checked

**Given** multiple specs exist for different features
**When** I edit any file in the project
**Then** the hook checks the modification against ALL existing specs, not just the current branch's spec

### AC3: No-Op When No Specs Exist

**Given** no spec files exist in `specs/`
**When** I edit any file
**Then** the hook short-circuits immediately without spawning an agent

### AC4: Hook Fires on Write and Edit

**Given** specs exist in the project
**When** I use the Write or Edit tool
**Then** the PostToolUse hook fires and checks for spec alignment

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| FR1 | PostToolUse hook on Write and Edit tool calls | Must | Matcher: `Write\|Edit` |
| FR2 | Agent-type hook that reads spec files for drift comparison | Must | Can use Glob/Read |
| FR3 | Check modifications against ALL existing specs | Must | Not just current branch |
| FR4 | Command-type gate that short-circuits when no specs exist | Must | `ls specs/*/requirements.md` |
| FR5 | Clear drift explanation referencing specific spec requirements | Must | JSON response with reason |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Command gate short-circuits in <100ms when no specs exist |
| **Security** | Hook reads spec files only, no write access |
| **Reliability** | Agent timeout of 60 seconds prevents hangs |

## UI/UX Requirements

Reference `structure.md` and `product.md` for project-specific design standards.

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Interaction** | [Touch targets, gesture requirements] |
| **Typography** | [Minimum text sizes, font requirements] |
| **Contrast** | [Accessibility contrast requirements] |
| **Loading States** | [How loading should be displayed] |
| **Error States** | [How errors should be displayed] |
| **Empty States** | [How empty data should be displayed] |
