## Architecture Assessment

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Single Responsibility | 5 | Skill verifies; agent reviews architecture; checklists define criteria |
| Open/Closed | 5 | New checklists can be added without modifying skill |
| Liskov Substitution | N/A | No inheritance |
| Interface Segregation | 5 | Six separate checklists, not one monolithic review |
| Dependency Inversion | 5 | Skill delegates to agent abstraction; checklists are pluggable |

### Layer Separation

Excellent: skill orchestration (SKILL.md) → agent delegation (architecture-reviewer.md) → criteria definition (checklists/) → output format (report-template.md). Four distinct layers.

### Dependency Flow

Unidirectional: SKILL.md → agent → checklists → report.

---

## Security Assessment

- [x] Reports contain file paths and scores only, no secrets
- [x] Architecture reviewer has read-only access
- [x] GitHub issue comments via authenticated `gh` CLI

---

## Performance Assessment

- [x] Agent runs as subagent (parallel execution)
- [x] Checklists are small Markdown files
- [x] Fix threshold (~20 lines) bounds execution time

## Test Coverage

### BDD Scenarios

| Acceptance Criterion | Has Scenario | Has Steps | Passes |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| AC1 — Spec verification | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC2 — Architecture review | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC3 — Auto-fix | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC4 — GitHub update | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC5 — Bug fix regression | Yes | N/A | Yes |

### Coverage Summary

- Feature files: 5 scenarios
- Step definitions: N/A (Markdown plugin)

---

## Fixes Applied

None — retroactive verification of shipped feature.

## Remaining Issues

### Critical Issues
None.
### High Priority
None.
### Medium Priority
None.
### Low Priority
None.

---

## Positive Observations

- Dedicated architecture-reviewer agent keeps review logic separate from orchestration
- Six granular checklists allow focused evaluation of different quality dimensions
- Fix/defer threshold provides pragmatic balance between automation and safety
- Report template ensures consistent, comprehensive output across all verifications

## Recommendation

**Ready for PR**

Feature has been implemented, verified, and merged. The verify-code skill is the most component-rich skill in the plugin, with a dedicated agent, six checklists, and a report template.
