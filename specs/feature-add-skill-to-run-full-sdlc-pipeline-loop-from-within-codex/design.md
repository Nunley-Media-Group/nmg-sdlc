# Design: Running SDLC Loop Skill

**Issues**: #107
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Codex

---

## Overview

This feature adds a new Codex skill (`run-loop`) to the nmg-sdlc plugin that orchestrates the full SDLC pipeline from within an active Codex session. Instead of reimplementing orchestration logic, the skill invokes the existing `sdlc-runner.mjs` script — the deterministic SDLC orchestrator — by unsetting the `` environment variable so it can spawn `codex exec` subprocesses.

The skill is a thin wrapper: it locates or generates a config file, then runs `node sdlc-runner.mjs --config <path>`. The runner already handles issue selection, phase sequencing, precondition/postcondition validation, retry logic, failure detection, and state management. This reuse avoids duplicating proven orchestration logic.

To support single-issue mode, the runner gains a new `--issue N` CLI flag that restricts processing to a single specified issue number and exits after one cycle (no loop).

### Data Flow

```
1. User invokes /nmg-sdlc:run-loop [#N]
2. Skill checks for sdlc-config.json at project root
3. If missing, invokes /init-config to create it
4. Reads config to resolve pluginsPath
5. Derives runner path: <pluginsPath>/scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs
6. Builds command:
   - Loop mode:    node <runner> --config <config>
   - Single issue: node <runner> --config <config> --issue N
7. Executes runner via Bash tool (long-running, may take hours)
8. Reports runner exit status and any failure diagnostics
```

## Skill Interface

### SKILL.md Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: run-loop
description: "Run the full SDLC pipeline loop for automatable issues. Use when user says 'run SDLC loop', 'run the pipeline', 'process all issues', 'run SDLC for #N', or 'automate the milestone'. Do NOT use for individual phases (write-spec, write-code, etc.)."
usage hint: "[#issue-number]"
workflow instructions: Read, file discovery, text search, Bash(node:*), Bash(test:*), Bash(cat:*), Skill
---
```

**Tool rationale:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Read` | Read config file, check unattended-mode |
| `file discovery` | Find config files |
| `text search` | Search config for paths |
| `Bash(node:*)` | Invoke the runner: `node sdlc-runner.mjs ...` |
| `Bash(test:*)` | File existence checks (`test -f sdlc-config.json`) |
| `Bash(cat:*)` | Read runner output / logs if needed |
| `Skill` | Invoke `/init-config` if config is missing |

**Note**: The skill's own logic is lightweight (config resolution + runner invocation). The runner spawns its own Codex sessions with their own model settings from the config file.

### Arguments

| Argument | Format | Behavior |
|----------|--------|----------|
| None | `/nmg-sdlc:run-loop` | Loop mode — runner processes all automatable issues continuously |
| Issue number | `/nmg-sdlc:run-loop #107` or `107` | Single-issue mode — runner processes only this issue then exits |

---

## Runner Enhancement: `--issue N` Flag

### Change to `sdlc-runner.mjs`

Add a new `--issue` CLI option that restricts the runner to a single specified issue:

#### CLI Parsing

```javascript
// Add to parseArgs options:
'issue': { type: 'string' },

// After parsing:
let SINGLE_ISSUE_NUMBER = args.issue ? parseInt(args.issue, 10) : null;
```

#### Behavior When `--issue N` Is Provided

| Aspect | Default (no flag) | With `--issue N` |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Issue selection (Step 2) | Prompt Codex to select next automatable issue | Prompt Codex to start issue #N specifically |
| Loop behavior | After step 9, loop back to step 1 for next issue | After step 9, exit with code 0 (single cycle) |
| Escalation | Escalate + exit with non-zero code | Escalate + exit with non-zero code |
| `hasOpenIssues` check | Controls loop continuation | Skipped — single issue doesn't need it |

#### Step 2 Prompt Modification

When `SINGLE_ISSUE_NUMBER` is set, the step 2 prompt changes from:

```
"Select and start the next GitHub issue from the current milestone..."
```

to:

```
"Start issue #N. Create a linked feature branch and set the issue to In Progress."
```

#### Main Loop Exit Condition

After step 9 completes successfully with `--issue`:

```javascript
if (result === 'ok' && step.number === 9 && SINGLE_ISSUE_NUMBER) {
  log(`Single-issue mode: issue #${SINGLE_ISSUE_NUMBER} complete. Exiting.`);
  break; // Exit the main while loop
}
```

#### Escalation Behavior

Escalation should exit the runner with a non-zero status in both continuous mode and single-issue mode. This preserves the failed issue as the manual recovery target and prevents the same invocation from burying partial work under a later issue.

```javascript
if (result === 'escalated') {
  removeUnattendedMode();
  process.exitCode = 1;
  break;
}
```

---

## Config File Resolution

### Location Strategy

The skill checks for config in this order:

1. `sdlc-config.json` at project root (standard location from `/init-config`)
2. If not found: invoke `Skill("nmg-sdlc:init-config")` to create it
3. Re-read the newly created config

### Runner Path Derivation

From the config file:

```json
{
  "pluginsPath": "/Users/user/.codex/plugins/marketplaces/nmg-plugins",
  ...
}
```

Runner path = `<pluginsPath>/scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs`

Verify the runner exists before invoking:

```bash
test -f "<pluginsPath>/scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs"
```

If missing, report error: "Runner script not found. Ensure nmg-plugins marketplace is cloned."

---

## Codex runner invocation pattern

Codex sets the `` environment variable in all child processes. The Codex CLI refuses to start inside another Codex session when this is set. Unsetting it allows the runner to spawn `codex exec` subprocesses:

```bash
node <runner-path> --config <config-path>
```

This is a known and documented pattern (see memory: "Exercise Testing Skills" section).

---

## Auto-Mode Behavior

The runner **automatically creates `.codex/unattended-mode`** on startup (line 1917-1923 of `sdlc-runner.mjs`). This means:

- The skill does NOT need to manage unattended-mode — the runner handles it
- The runner removes unattended-mode on exit (`removeAutoMode()`)
- Phase skills inside the runner's `codex exec` subprocesses will detect unattended-mode and skip interactive prompts

---

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|-------------|------|------|----------|
| **A: Use Skill tool for in-session invocation** | Invoke each phase skill directly via Skill tool within the same session | Shared context; no subprocess spawning | Reimplements orchestration logic (preconditions, retries, state, soft failures); context window exhaustion over multiple issues; no CI monitoring or merge steps | Rejected — duplicates proven logic |
| **B: Invoke sdlc-runner.mjs with =""** | Run the existing runner script, unsetting  to enable subprocess spawning | Reuses all existing orchestration; battle-tested retry/escalation/state logic; includes CI monitoring and merge; isolated contexts per step prevent exhaustion | Requires long Bash timeout; adds `--issue` flag to runner | **Selected** — maximizes reuse, minimizes risk |
| **C: Use Task tool to spawn runner in background** | Run the runner via Task tool's background mode | Doesn't block the session | Task tool results are limited; harder to stream progress | Rejected — Bash with long timeout is simpler |

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Bash timeout for long-running runner | Medium | High — runner killed mid-cycle | Use `run_in_background: true` or set timeout to maximum (600000ms) with clear documentation |
| Config file missing or incorrect | Low | Medium — runner fails to start | Skill checks for config first and generates via `/init-config` if missing |
| Runner path resolution fails | Low | High — skill can't invoke runner | Verify path exists before invocation; provide clear error message |
| `=""` pattern breaks in future Codex versions | Low | High — subprocess spawning fails | Pattern is documented and used by exercise testing; would affect all testing too |
| `--issue` flag introduces regressions in runner | Low | Medium | Runner has existing test suite in `scripts/__tests__/`; add tests for new flag |

---

## Testing Strategy

| Layer | Type | Coverage |
|-------|------|----------|
| SKILL.md | Prompt quality review | Unambiguous instructions, correct tool refs, complete workflow paths |
| SKILL.md | `/doing-skills-right` validation | Frontmatter, workflow instructions, unattended-mode, integration section (AC5) |
| `sdlc-runner.mjs` | Unit tests (Jest) | New `--issue` flag behavior: single-cycle exit, prompt modification, escalation exit |
| Feature | Exercise testing | Load plugin, invoke skill against a test project; verify runner starts and processes issue |
| Integration | End-to-end | Process 1 issue in single-issue mode, verify PR created; process 2+ in loop mode |

---

## File Changes

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/run-loop/SKILL.md` | **New** | The skill definition — thin wrapper around runner invocation |
| `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs` | **Modify** | Add `--issue N` CLI flag for single-issue mode |
