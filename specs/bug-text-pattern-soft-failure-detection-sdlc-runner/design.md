# Root Cause Analysis: Text-Pattern Soft Failure Detection Missing from SDLC Runner

**Issues**: #86
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Draft
**Author**: Claude (nmg-sdlc)

## Root Cause

The `detectSoftFailure()` function in `sdlc-runner.mjs` was designed to catch failures where Claude Code exits with code 0 but did not actually succeed. It does this by parsing the stream-json output for two JSON-level indicators: `subtype: "error_max_turns"` and non-empty `permission_denials`. This was the correct initial implementation (issue #38) because those were the known soft failure modes at the time.

However, some failure modes produce text-only output that never appears in the structured JSON result. For example, when a skill calls `EnterPlanMode` in a headless/pipe session, Claude Code prints a text error message to stdout (not as a JSON-structured event) and continues or exits cleanly. Similarly, `AskUserQuestion` called when unattended-mode is active may produce text warnings. The `detectSoftFailure()` function calls `extractResultFromStream()` to get the JSON result object and inspects only its fields — it never scans the raw stdout/stderr text for failure indicators.

The existing `matchErrorPattern()` function _does_ scan raw text output, but it only runs inside `handleFailure()` — which is the non-zero exit code path or the path after a soft failure has already been detected. There is no text scanning in the exit-code-0 success path before `detectSoftFailure()` returns its verdict.

### Affected Code

| File | Lines | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs` | 1061–1079 | `detectSoftFailure()` — only checks JSON fields, never scans raw text |
| `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs` | 1036–1051 | `matchErrorPattern()` / `IMMEDIATE_ESCALATION_PATTERNS` — existing text scanning, but only used in the failure path |
| `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs` | 1669–1676 | Call site in `runStep()` — calls `detectSoftFailure(result.stdout)` and writes a `[STATUS]` line on match |

### Triggering Conditions

- A skill produces a text-based failure message on stdout or stderr (e.g., "EnterPlanMode called in headless session")
- The Claude Code process exits with code 0
- The JSON result object does not contain `error_max_turns` subtype or `permission_denials`
- The runner's exit-code-0 path calls `detectSoftFailure()` which finds no JSON failure indicators
- The step is classified as successful

## Fix Strategy

### Approach

Add text-pattern scanning to `detectSoftFailure()`. After the existing JSON checks (which remain unchanged), if no JSON-based soft failure is found, scan the raw stdout string against a new constant array of regex patterns representing known text-based failure indicators. If any pattern matches, return a soft failure result with a `text_pattern:` reason prefix.

The patterns are defined as a module-level constant array (`TEXT_FAILURE_PATTERNS`) for maintainability, following the same pattern as the existing `IMMEDIATE_ESCALATION_PATTERNS` and `BENIGN_DENIED_TOOLS` constants. Each entry includes a regex and a human-readable label used in the reason string and `[STATUS]` log lines.

The function signature and return type remain unchanged — callers already handle `{ isSoftFailure: true, reason: string }` — so no changes are needed at the call site in `runStep()` or in `handleFailure()`.

### Changes

| File | Change | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs` | Add `TEXT_FAILURE_PATTERNS` constant array near existing `IMMEDIATE_ESCALATION_PATTERNS` (~line 1036) | Centralizes text patterns for maintainability; follows existing code pattern |
| `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs` | Extend `detectSoftFailure()` to scan raw `stdout` against `TEXT_FAILURE_PATTERNS` after JSON checks (~line 1077) | Core fix — detects text-based failures that JSON inspection misses |
| `scripts/__tests__/sdlc-runner.test.mjs` | Add test cases for text-pattern soft failure detection | Regression prevention — ensures new and existing detection paths are covered |

### Blast Radius

- **Direct impact**: `detectSoftFailure()` function — gains an additional code path that returns `isSoftFailure: true` for text pattern matches
- **Indirect impact**: `runStep()` (line ~1671) — will now trigger the soft failure path for text-based failures (same as JSON failures). `handleFailure()` will be called, which triggers retry/escalation. The `[STATUS]` log line for the soft failure will include the `text_pattern:` reason.
- **Risk level**: Low — the new code path only fires when a known text pattern is found AND no JSON soft failure was detected. The return type is identical to existing soft failure returns. All downstream handling (retry, escalation, status logging) is unchanged.

## Regression Risk

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| False positive: a pattern matches normal output text | Low | Patterns are specific (e.g., `EnterPlanMode` is not a word that appears in normal success output). Test with representative success output samples. |
| JSON soft failure detection breaks | Very Low | JSON checks execute first, before text scanning. Only if JSON returns no failure does text scanning run. Existing tests cover JSON path. |
| Text scanning adds latency | Very Low | Regex scanning a few KB of stdout against 3-5 patterns is negligible. No network calls or I/O involved. |
| Pattern list becomes stale as new failure modes emerge | Low | Patterns are in a clearly-named constant. Adding new patterns is a one-line change with no structural risk. |

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Description | Why Not Selected |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Extend `matchErrorPattern()` and call it from the exit-code-0 path | Reuse existing text scanning infrastructure | `matchErrorPattern()` returns `{ action: 'escalate' | 'wait' }` which is semantically different from soft failure detection. Conflating the two would complicate both paths. Better to keep them separate. |
| Make patterns configurable via `sdlc-config.json` | Allow per-project customization of failure patterns | Over-engineering for the current need. The patterns are universal to Claude Code behavior, not project-specific. Can be added later if needed. |
