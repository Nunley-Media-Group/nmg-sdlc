## Architecture Assessment

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Single Responsibility | 5 | Skill does one thing: set up an issue for development |
| Open/Closed | 4 | Supports milestone and non-milestone modes |
| Liskov Substitution | N/A | No inheritance |
| Interface Segregation | 4 | Steps are cleanly separated |
| Dependency Inversion | 4 | Depends on `gh` CLI abstraction |

### Layer Separation

Clear: issue discovery → selection → branch creation → status update. Each step is independent.

### Dependency Flow

Linear: GitHub API → user selection → `gh issue develop` → GraphQL mutation.

---

## Security Assessment

- [x] All operations via authenticated `gh` CLI
- [x] GraphQL mutations scoped to status field only

---

## Performance Assessment

- [x] Single API calls for milestone and issue fetching
- [x] Branch creation is fast (local git + remote push)

---

## Test Coverage

### BDD Scenarios

| Acceptance Criterion | Has Scenario | Has Steps | Passes |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| AC1 — Issue selection | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC2 — Branch creation | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC3 — Status update | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC4 — Unattended-mode | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC5 — Argument support | Yes | N/A | Yes |

### Coverage Summary

- Feature files: 5 scenarios
- Step definitions: N/A (Markdown plugin)

## Fixes Applied

None — retroactive verification of shipped feature.

## Remaining Issues

### Critical Issues
None.
### High Priority
None.
### Medium Priority
None.
### Low Priority
None.

---

## Positive Observations

- Milestone-scoped issue listing with fallback provides flexible issue discovery
- `gh issue develop` creates and links the branch in a single command
- GraphQL integration for project status updates is sophisticated and handles missing projects gracefully
