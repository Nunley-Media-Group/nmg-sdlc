# Requirements: Starting Issues Skill

**Issues**: #10, #89
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Claude Code (retroactive)

---

## User Story

**As a** developer ready to begin work on a feature,
**I want** a skill that lets me select a GitHub issue, creates a linked feature branch, and sets the issue to In Progress,
**So that** I can start development with proper branch hygiene and issue tracking without manual setup.

---

## Background

The `/start-issue` skill was extracted from the earlier `/beginning-dev` skill to provide standalone issue selection and branch setup. It lists open GitHub issues, lets the developer select one (or accepts an issue number argument in unattended-mode), creates a feature branch linked to the issue via `gh issue develop`, and updates the issue status to "In Progress" in any associated GitHub Project. In unattended mode, issues are sorted by number ascending (oldest first) and selected automatically without user confirmation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Issue Selection Presents Open Issues

**Given** I invoke `/start-issue` in interactive mode
**When** the skill starts
**Then** it lists open GitHub issues for me to select from

### AC2: Feature Branch Is Created and Linked

**Given** I select a GitHub issue
**When** branch setup completes
**Then** a feature branch is created and linked to the issue via `gh issue develop`

### AC3: Issue Status Is Updated

**Given** a feature branch is created
**When** the issue is linked
**Then** the issue status is set to "In Progress" in any associated GitHub Project

### AC4: Unattended Mode Auto-Selects Oldest Issue

**Given** unattended mode is active
**When** `/start-issue` runs
**Then** it selects the oldest open issue (lowest number) without user confirmation

### AC5: Issue Number Can Be Provided as Argument

**Given** I invoke `/start-issue` with an issue number
**When** the skill runs
**Then** it skips issue selection and uses the provided issue number directly

### AC6: Diagnostic Context in Zero-Result Auto-Mode Output

**Given** `/start-issue` finds zero automatable issues in unattended-mode
**When** the result is returned
**Then** it additionally queries the total open issue count (without the `automatable` label filter, in the same milestone scope)
**And** includes it in the output (e.g., "No automatable issues found (N open issues exist without the automatable label)")

### AC7: Suggestion When Open Issues Exist Without Label

**Given** total open issues > 0 but automatable issues = 0
**When** the zero-result diagnostic output is returned
**Then** the output suggests checking label assignment as a potential cause (e.g., "Consider adding the `automatable` label to issues that should be picked up automatically.")

### AC8: No Misleading Suggestion When No Open Issues Exist

**Given** total open issues = 0 and automatable issues = 0
**When** the zero-result diagnostic output is returned
**Then** the output indicates no work is available without suggesting label checks (e.g., "No automatable issues found. 0 open issues in scope.")

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| FR1 | List open GitHub issues for interactive selection | Must | Via AskUserQuestion |
| FR2 | Feature branch creation linked via `gh issue develop` | Must | Creates and checks out branch |
| FR3 | Issue status update to "In Progress" in GitHub Projects | Must | Via GraphQL API |
| FR4 | Automation mode with oldest-first issue selection | Must | `.claude/unattended-mode` check |
| FR5 | Direct issue number argument support | Must | Skips selection steps |
| FR6 | Query total open issue count (same scope, without label filter) when automatable count is zero in unattended-mode | Must | Second `gh issue list` without `--label` |
| FR7 | Include total open issue count in zero-result diagnostic output | Must | Enhances the "No automatable issues found" message |
| FR8 | Suggest checking label assignment when open issues > 0 but automatable = 0 | Should | Actionable guidance for operators |
