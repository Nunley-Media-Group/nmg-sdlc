## Task Format

Each task follows this structure:

```
### T[NNN]: [Task Title]

**File(s)**: `{layer}/path/to/file`
**Type**: Create | Modify | Delete
**Depends**: T[NNN], T[NNN] (or None)
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] [Verifiable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Verifiable criterion 2]

**Notes**: [Optional implementation hints]
```

Map `{layer}/` placeholders to actual project paths using `structure.md`.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

No setup tasks — this feature modifies existing Markdown files only. No migrations, types, or new file structures needed.

---

## Phase 2: Skill Implementation

These tasks modify `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/SKILL.md` to add exercise-based verification as a conditional branch in Step 5.

### T001: Add Plugin Change Detection to Step 5

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Step 5 begins with a plugin change detection sub-step (5a)
- [ ] Instructions tell Codex to run `git diff main...HEAD --name-only` and check for patterns: `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `plugins/*/agents/*.md`
- [ ] If plugin changes detected, skill branches to exercise-based verification (sub-steps 5b–5e)
- [ ] If no plugin changes detected, existing BDD test coverage verification runs unchanged
- [ ] Detection logic is clearly documented with the file patterns it matches

**Notes**: Insert the conditional branch at the start of Step 5, before the existing BDD verification content. The existing content becomes the "else" branch. Template-only changes (without accompanying SKILL.md change) do not trigger exercise testing per Out of Scope.

### T002: Add Test Project Scaffolding Instructions

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T001
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Sub-step 5b instructs Codex to create a temp directory using cross-platform approach
- [ ] Scaffold includes: `steering/` with minimal `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`
- [ ] Scaffold includes: `src/index.js`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`
- [ ] Instructions include `git init && git add -A && git commit -m "initial"`
- [ ] Temp directory path is recorded for later cleanup
- [ ] Layout matches `structure.md` → Test Project Scaffolding

**Notes**: Use `Write` tool for file creation, `Bash` for git init. Reference the minimal content from design.md section 5b.

### T003: Add Exercise Invocation Instructions (Agent SDK + Fallback)

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T002
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Sub-step 5c describes the Agent SDK invocation method (primary)
- [ ] Includes inline Node.js snippet template for Agent SDK with `canUseTool` callback
- [ ] `canUseTool` intercepts `interactive user prompt` and auto-selects first option
- [ ] Plugin loaded via `plugins: [{ type: "local", path: ... }]`
- [ ] `workingDirectory` set to test project path
- [ ] Output captured to temp file for evaluation
- [ ] Fallback to `codex exec` with `` clearly described
- [ ] Fallback notes in report that only non-interactive path was tested
- [ ] 5-minute timeout described for exercise subprocess
- [ ] For GitHub-integrated skills: dry-run prompt prepended to prevent real artifact creation

**Notes**: The Agent SDK check is done by attempting to import the module. The `codex exec` pattern follows `sdlc-runner.mjs` subprocess invocation style. Dry-run instructions prepend context to the exercise prompt telling Codex not to execute `gh` commands that create/modify/delete resources.

### T004: Add Output Evaluation and Cleanup Instructions

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T003
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Sub-step 5d instructs Codex to read the captured output and evaluate against each AC from `requirements.md`
- [ ] Each AC gets a verdict: Pass / Fail / Partial with evidence
- [ ] For file-creating skills: check the test project filesystem for expected artifacts
- [ ] For GitHub-integrated skills: evaluate generated `gh` command content against ACs
- [ ] Sub-step 5e instructs cleanup: `rm -rf {test-project-path}`
- [ ] Cleanup runs regardless of exercise success or failure
- [ ] Exercise findings are fed into Step 6 (Fix Findings) like any other finding

**Notes**: Codex performs the evaluation by reasoning about AC satisfaction from the captured output. This is consistent with how Step 3 (Verify Implementation) already works.

### T005: Add Graceful Degradation Handling

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T003
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] If Agent SDK import fails AND Codex CLI not found: skip exercise testing entirely
- [ ] If exercise subprocess times out (5 min): kill process and report skip
- [ ] If exercise produces an error: capture error, report as finding, continue
- [ ] All skip/failure scenarios produce a clear entry in the verification report
- [ ] Skipped exercise testing includes recommendation for manual follow-up
- [ ] Non-fatal: graceful degradation never blocks the rest of the verification workflow

**Notes**: Graceful degradation follows the same pattern as existing Step 5 — report gaps, don't block.

---

## Phase 3: Report Template

### T006: Add Exercise Test Results Section to Report Template

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/checklists/report-template.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] New "Exercise Test Results" section added after the existing "Test Coverage" section
- [ ] Section includes: skill exercised, test project path, exercise method, interactive user prompt handling, duration
- [ ] Section includes: captured output summary, AC evaluation table (AC / Description / Verdict / Evidence)
- [ ] Section includes: notes field for observations (fallback method, dry-run mode, etc.)
- [ ] Skipped variant included: reason and manual follow-up recommendation
- [ ] Section is clearly marked as conditional ("included when exercise-based verification was performed")

**Notes**: The section template follows the format described in design.md → Report Template Extension.

---

## Phase 4: Integration

### T007: Verify Step 5 ↔ Report Template Consistency

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/SKILL.md`, `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/checklists/report-template.md`
**Type**: Verify (review, no file changes expected)
**Depends**: T001, T002, T003, T004, T005, T006
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Step 7 (Generate Verification Report) references the new Exercise Test Results section
- [ ] All data captured during sub-steps 5a–5e has a corresponding field in the report template
- [ ] The existing report sections (Test Coverage, Fixes Applied, Remaining Issues) still work with exercise findings
- [ ] Unattended-mode behavior is consistent: no `interactive user prompt` calls in the exercise path when `.codex/unattended-mode` exists
- [ ] Cross-reference between Step 5 exercise output and Step 7 report generation is clear

**Notes**: This is a review task to ensure the skill and template are consistent. Make minor edits if gaps are found.

---

## Phase 5: BDD Testing

### T008: Create BDD Feature File

**File(s)**: `specs/44-exercise-based-verification/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Create
**Depends**: T001, T006
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] All 10 acceptance criteria from requirements.md have corresponding Gherkin scenarios
- [ ] Scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Feature file is valid Gherkin syntax
- [ ] Includes happy path (AC1–AC3), alternative paths (AC4–AC5), error handling (AC8–AC9), and edge cases (AC10)
- [ ] Scenarios are independent and self-contained

**Notes**: This feature file serves as the verification criteria for exercise-based testing of the modified `/verify-code` skill itself (dogfooding).

---

## Phase 6: ESM Module Resolution — Issue #50

These tasks modify the exercise testing reference file to fix ESM module resolution when the Agent SDK is installed in a non-standard location (e.g., npx cache).

### T009: Replace SDK Availability Check with Path-Resolving Check

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/references/exercise-testing.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T003
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] The `require('Codex Agent SDK')` availability check is replaced with `require.resolve('Codex Agent SDK')` that outputs the resolved absolute path
- [ ] A fallback search is added that checks known SDK locations (npx cache on macOS/Linux/Windows) if `require.resolve` fails
- [ ] The resolution step outputs the SDK entry point absolute path on success (exit code 0) or exits with code 1 if not found
- [ ] The resolved path is used as the decision gateway: path found → Agent SDK method, not found → `codex exec` fallback
- [ ] No symlinks are created during resolution

**Notes**: The resolution uses CJS `require.resolve()` which respects `NODE_PATH` and searches more locations than ESM bare-specifier resolution. The fallback search uses `node:fs` and `node:path` for cross-platform path construction. See design.md section 5c-i for the full resolution strategy.

### T010: Update Exercise Script Template with Dynamic Import

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/verify-code/references/exercise-testing.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T009
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] The static ESM import `import { query } from "Codex Agent SDK"` is replaced with a dynamic import using the resolved path
- [ ] The script uses `import { pathToFileURL } from "node:url"` and `await import(pathToFileURL("{sdk-entry-point}").href)` for cross-platform file URL conversion
- [ ] The `{sdk-entry-point}` placeholder is documented as being populated from the resolution step (T009)
- [ ] The rest of the exercise script (query invocation, output capture) remains unchanged
- [ ] The script template is valid ESM syntax that Node.js v22+ can execute

**Notes**: `pathToFileURL` correctly handles Windows drive letters (`C:\...` → `file:///C:/...`) and special characters in paths. Dynamic `import()` works with `file://` URLs regardless of `NODE_PATH` or `node_modules` hierarchy.

### T011: Update BDD Feature File with ESM Resolution Scenarios

**File(s)**: `specs/feature-exercise-based-verification/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T009, T010
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Gherkin scenario for AC11 (resolve SDK from non-standard location) is added
- [ ] Gherkin scenario for AC12 (no symlink dependency) is added
- [ ] Gherkin scenario for AC13 (consistent availability check) is added
- [ ] New scenarios are tagged with a comment indicating Issue #50 contribution
- [ ] All scenarios use Given/When/Then format and are valid Gherkin syntax

**Notes**: These scenarios are appended after the existing scenarios in the feature file. They cover the ESM module resolution enhancement from Issue #50.
