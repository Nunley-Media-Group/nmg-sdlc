## Overview

The `/verify-code` skill is the quality gate of the nmg-sdlc workflow. It performs a comprehensive 9-step verification: load specs, load issue, verify implementation against acceptance criteria, run architecture review via the `architecture-reviewer` subagent, verify test coverage, fix findings (under ~20 lines), generate a verification report, update the GitHub issue, and output results.

The architecture review is delegated to a dedicated `nmg-sdlc:architecture-reviewer` agent that evaluates code against five checklist dimensions: SOLID principles, security (OWASP-aligned), performance patterns, testability, and error handling. Six checklist files in `checklists/` provide the evaluation criteria, and a report template standardizes the output format.

For bug fixes, verification shifts focus to reproduction checks, `@regression` scenario validation, blast radius assessment, and minimal change audit.

### Data Flow

```
1. Load spec files from specs/{feature-name}/
   1a. Load steering docs (steering/)
   1b. Parse ## Verification Gates table from tech.md → extract named gates
2. Read GitHub issue via gh issue view
3. For each AC: find implementing code via file discovery and text search → mark Pass/Fail
4. Spawn architecture-reviewer agent with Task tool
5. Check BDD scenario coverage against ACs
   5f. Execute each applicable verification gate:
       - Evaluate condition (file/dir exists, "always", etc.)
       - If applicable: run action via Bash, evaluate pass criteria
       - If not applicable: skip (not recorded as Incomplete)
       - If applicable but unexecutable: record as Incomplete with reason
6. Fix findings under ~20 lines; defer larger ones
7. Generate report from report-template.md (includes gate results section)
8. Post verification comment on GitHub issue
9. Output summary with scores, gate results, and recommendation
```

## Verification Gates Design

### Gate Definition Format (tech.md)

The `## Verification Gates` section in a project's `tech.md` declares mandatory verification steps using a structured table:

```markdown
## Verification Gates

| Gate | Condition | Action | Pass Criteria |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Robot E2E Tests | `integration_test/` directory exists | `flutter test integration_test/` | Exit code 0 |
| API Contract Tests | `contracts/` directory exists | `npm run test:contracts` | Exit code 0 |
| Accessibility Audit | Always | `npx pa11y-ci` | Exit code 0 |
| Coverage Threshold | Always | `npm run test:coverage` | `coverage/lcov.info` file generated AND exit code 0 |
```

**Column semantics:**

| Column | Purpose | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Gate** | Human-readable gate name (used in report) | "Robot E2E Tests", "Load Tests" |
| **Condition** | When the gate applies — evaluated before execution | `Always`, `path/to/dir/ directory exists`, `*.feature files exist in test/` |
| **Action** | Shell command to execute | Any shell command; evaluated via Bash tool |
| **Pass Criteria** | How to determine success | `Exit code 0`, `Exit code 0 AND output contains "PASSED"`, `report.xml file generated` |

**Condition evaluation rules:**
- `Always` — gate always applies
- `{path} directory exists` — check via `test -d {path}`
- `{glob} files exist in {path}` — check via `ls {path}/{glob}` or file discovery tool
- If no `## Verification Gates` section exists in tech.md → no gates are enforced (backward-compatible)

**Pass criteria evaluation rules:**
- `Exit code 0` — check the exit code of the Action command
- `{file} file generated` — check that the file exists after Action completes (artifact verification)
- Compound criteria use `AND` — all sub-criteria must be satisfied
- The skill evaluates these textual criteria against the actual result; it does NOT contain stack-specific logic

### Gate Execution Logic (Step 5f)

After BDD/exercise verification in Step 5, the skill executes each extracted gate:

```
For each gate extracted from tech.md:
  1. Evaluate Condition
     - If condition is not met → skip gate (not included in report)
     - If condition cannot be evaluated → record as Incomplete("Cannot evaluate condition: {reason}")

  2. Execute Action
     - Run the Action command via Bash
     - Capture exit code, stdout, and stderr
     - If command not found or prerequisites missing → record as Incomplete("Tool unavailable: {details}")
     - If command times out → record as Incomplete("Command timed out")

  3. Evaluate Pass Criteria
     - Parse the Pass Criteria string
     - Check exit code if specified
     - Check artifact existence if specified
     - Check output content if specified
     - All sub-criteria must pass → gate Pass
     - Any sub-criteria fails → gate Fail

  4. Record Result
     - Gate name, status (Pass/Fail/Incomplete), evidence (output excerpt or blocker reason)
```

### Status Aggregation

Gate results affect the overall verification status:

| Gate Results | Overall Status Impact |
|-------------|----------------------|
| All gates Pass | No effect (status determined by other factors) |
| Any gate Fail, none Incomplete | Overall status cannot exceed "Partial" |
| Any gate Incomplete, none Fail | Overall status cannot exceed "Incomplete" |
| Mix of Fail and Incomplete | Overall status cannot exceed "Incomplete" |
| No `## Verification Gates` section | No effect (backward-compatible) |

The hierarchy from best to worst: Pass > Partial > Incomplete > Fail.

### Report Template Section

A new "Steering Doc Verification Gates" section is added to `report-template.md` between "Exercise Test Results" and "Fixes Applied":

```markdown
## Steering Doc Verification Gates

*Include this section when verification gates were extracted from tech.md. Omit entirely if tech.md has no `## Verification Gates` section.*

| Gate | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| [gate name] | Pass / Fail / Incomplete | [output excerpt, artifact path, or blocker reason] |

**Gate Summary**: [X/Y] gates passed, [Z] failed, [W] incomplete
```

### Migration Path

The `setup-steering` tech.md template is updated to include the `## Verification Gates` section with placeholder content. The `migrate-project` skill is template-driven — it detects missing sections by comparing a project's `tech.md` headings against the template's headings. Adding the section to the template automatically enables migration detection for existing projects. No code changes to migrate-project are needed; the design relies on its existing section-merge mechanism.

## API / Interface Changes

### New Endpoints / Methods

| Endpoint / Method | Type | Auth | Purpose |
|-------------------|------|------|---------|
| [path or signature] | [GET/POST/etc or method] | [Yes/No] | [description] |

### Request / Response Schemas

#### [Endpoint or Method Name]

**Input:**
```json
{
  "field1": "string",
  "field2": 123
}
```

**Output (success):**
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "field1": "string",
  "createdAt": "ISO8601"
}
```

**Errors:**

| Code / Type | Condition |
|-------------|-----------|
| [error code] | [when this happens] |

## Database / Storage Changes

### Schema Changes

| Table / Collection | Column / Field | Type | Nullable | Default | Change |
|--------------------|----------------|------|----------|---------|--------|
| [name] | [name] | [type] | Yes/No | [value] | Add/Modify/Remove |

### Migration Plan

```
-- Describe the migration approach
-- Reference tech.md for migration conventions
```

### Data Migration

[If existing data needs transformation, describe the approach]

---

## State Management

Reference `structure.md` and `tech.md` for the project's state management patterns.

### New State Shape

```
// Pseudocode — use project's actual language/framework
FeatureState {
  isLoading: boolean
  items: List<Item>
  error: string | null
  selected: Item | null
}
```

### State Transitions

```
Initial → Loading → Success (with data)
                  → Error (with message)

User action → Optimistic update → Confirm / Rollback
```

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Description | Decision |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Read-only verification | Report findings without fixing | Rejected — auto-fix saves developer time |
| Fix everything | Auto-fix all findings regardless of size | Rejected — large fixes need human review |
| **Fix small, defer large** | Auto-fix <20 lines, defer the rest | **Selected** — safe and efficient |
| Prose-based gate detection | Parse natural language in tech.md to infer mandatory gates | Rejected — unreliable, ambiguous, not actionable (#109) |
| Separate gates.md file | Put gates in a standalone file outside tech.md | Rejected — adds file overhead; tech.md already defines technical constraints (#109) |
| **Structured table in tech.md** | `## Verification Gates` section with Name/Condition/Action/Pass Criteria columns | **Selected** — stack-agnostic, parseable, lives with other tech constraints (#109) |
| Hard fail on Incomplete gates | Treat Incomplete as Fail | Rejected — penalizes environments where tools are legitimately absent (#109) |
| **Incomplete as distinct status** | Separate Incomplete from Pass and Fail | **Selected** — distinguishes "didn't run" from "ran and failed" (#109) |
