# Requirements: Verifying Specs Skill

**Issues**: #7, #109
**Date**: 2026-03-03
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Codex (retroactive)

## User Story

**As a** developer who has implemented a feature,
**I want** automated verification that my implementation matches the spec, with architecture review and automatic fixing of issues,
**So that** I can catch spec drift, architectural problems, and missing requirements before opening a PR.

---

## Background

The `/verify-code` skill validates that the implementation matches the specification, then runs an architecture review using a dedicated subagent. It actively fixes findings during verification — prioritizing fixes, running tests after each fix, re-verifying, and deferring items that exceed ~20 lines of change. The skill delegates architecture evaluation (SOLID principles, security/OWASP, performance, testability, error handling) to the `nmg-sdlc:architecture-reviewer` agent. The final report includes "Fixes Applied" and "Remaining Issues" sections, and the GitHub issue is updated with verification evidence. For bug fixes, verification focuses on reproduction checks, `@regression` scenario validation, blast radius, and minimal change audit.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Implementation Is Verified Against Spec

**Given** I invoke `/verify-code` for a completed feature
**When** verification runs
**Then** each acceptance criterion and functional requirement from the spec is checked against the implementation

### AC2: Architecture Review Evaluates Quality

**Given** spec verification is complete
**When** the architecture review runs
**Then** the `architecture-reviewer` agent evaluates SOLID principles, security, performance, testability, and error handling

### AC3: Findings Are Fixed During Verification

**Given** findings are discovered during verification
**When** a finding requires fewer than ~20 lines to fix
**Then** the skill fixes it, runs tests, and re-verifies; larger findings are deferred

### AC4: GitHub Issue Is Updated With Evidence

**Given** verification is complete
**When** the report is generated
**Then** the GitHub issue is updated with a comment containing verification results

### AC5: Bug Fix Verification Checks Regression

**Given** the feature is a bug fix
**When** verification runs
**Then** it checks reproduction, validates `@regression` scenarios, audits blast radius, and confirms minimal change scope

### AC6: Structured Verification Gates Section in tech.md

**Given** a project with a `tech.md` steering document
**When** the project defines mandatory verification constraints
**Then** the constraints are declared in a structured `## Verification Gates` section with a table containing: gate name, applicability condition, verification command/action, and pass criteria

### AC7: Gate Extraction During Verification

**Given** a project's `tech.md` contains a `## Verification Gates` section
**When** the verify-code skill runs Step 1 (Load Specifications and Steering Docs)
**Then** the skill extracts each gate as a named mandatory step to be executed during Step 5

### AC8: Gate Enforcement During Test Verification

**Given** the skill has extracted mandatory verification gates from steering docs
**When** Step 5 (Verify Test Coverage) executes
**Then** each applicable gate is executed as an explicit sub-step, the gate's pass criteria are evaluated against the actual result (supporting both exit code checks and artifact/output verification), and the gate is recorded with its outcome

### AC9: Incomplete Status for Unexecutable Gates

**Given** a mandatory verification gate cannot be executed (e.g., prerequisites not met, tool unavailable)
**When** the skill evaluates the gate
**Then** the overall verification status is set to "Incomplete" (not Pass or Fail), and the gate is recorded as unevaluated with the reason

### AC10: Report Template Includes Gate Results

**Given** verification gates were extracted from steering docs
**When** the verification report is generated (Step 7)
**Then** the report includes a mandatory "Steering Doc Verification Gates" section listing each gate with its status (Pass/Fail/Incomplete) and evidence or blocker reason

### AC11: Pass Report Requires All Gates Satisfied

**Given** one or more verification gates have status Incomplete or Fail
**When** the overall verification status is determined
**Then** the status cannot be "Pass" — it must be "Partial" (some gates failed) or "Incomplete" (gates were not executed)

### AC12: Stack-Agnostic Gate Definitions

**Given** verification gates are defined in `tech.md`
**When** different projects define different gates (e.g., E2E robot tests, load tests, accessibility audits, API contract tests)
**Then** the mechanism works for any gate type without the skill containing stack-specific logic

### AC13: Migration Path for Existing Projects

**Given** an existing project with a `tech.md` that lacks the `## Verification Gates` section
**When** a developer runs `/migrate-project` after updating the nmg-sdlc plugin
**Then** the migrate-project skill detects the missing `## Verification Gates` section and offers to add it (with the structured table template) via the standard section-merge workflow

| **Performance** | Verification completes within a single skill invocation |
| **Security** | No secrets exposed in verification reports or issue comments |
| **Reliability** | Deferred findings are clearly documented, not silently dropped |

- Security scanning with external tools (SAST/DAST)
- Automated deployment verification
- Automatically detecting verification constraints from prose (structured `## Verification Gates` section is required)
- Executing gates that require interactive prerequisites (e.g., starting a simulator) — these should be reported as Incomplete with the prerequisite documented
- Changes to the write-spec or write-code skills
- Defining specific gates for any particular project (each project defines its own)
- Changes to the migrate-project skill code (it is self-updating and reads templates at runtime)
