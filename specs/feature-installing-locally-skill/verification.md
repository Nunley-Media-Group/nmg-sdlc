## Architecture Assessment

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Single Responsibility | 5 | Skill does one thing: install all plugins locally |
| Open/Closed | 4 | Reads marketplace.json dynamically — new plugins installed automatically |
| Liskov Substitution | N/A | No inheritance |
| Interface Segregation | 4 | 5 steps are cleanly separated |
| Dependency Inversion | 4 | Depends on marketplace.json format, not specific plugins |

### Layer Separation

Clean: marketplace discovery → plugin sync → registry update.

### Dependency Flow

Linear: marketplace.json → rsync → installed_plugins.json.

---

## Security Assessment

- [x] All operations are local (no remote downloads)
- [x] `rsync --delete` safely manages stale files
- [x] `chmod +x` scoped to hook scripts only

---

## Performance Assessment

- [x] Incremental `rsync` only copies changed files
- [x] Single pass through plugins array
- [x] `git pull` is incremental

---

## Test Coverage

### BDD Scenarios

| Acceptance Criterion | Has Scenario | Has Steps | Passes |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
