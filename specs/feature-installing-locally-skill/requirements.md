# Requirements: Installing Locally Skill

**Issues**: #15
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Claude Code (retroactive)

---

## User Story

**As a** plugin developer or user,
**I want** a one-command skill that installs all marketplace plugins to my local Claude Code configuration,
**So that** I can use or test the latest plugin versions without manually copying files.

---

## Background

The `/installing-locally` skill is a repo-level utility (in `.claude/skills/`, not part of any individual plugin) that installs all plugins from the marketplace to the user's local `~/.claude/plugins/` directory. It reads the marketplace index to discover available plugins, copies their skills, hooks, and agents to the appropriate local directories, and handles any necessary cleanup of stale files.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: All Marketplace Plugins Are Installed

**Given** I invoke `/installing-locally` in the nmg-plugins repo
**When** the skill completes
**Then** all plugins listed in `marketplace.json` are installed to `~/.claude/plugins/`

### AC2: Skills, Hooks, and Agents Are Copied

**Given** a plugin has skills, hooks, and agents
**When** installation runs
**Then** all skill directories, hook configurations, and agent definitions are copied to the local plugin directory
