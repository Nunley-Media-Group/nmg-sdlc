# Tasks: migrate-project Respects unattended-mode Despite Spec Excluding It

**Issue**: #46
**Date**: 2026-02-16
**Status**: Planning
**Author**: Codex

---

## Summary

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| T001 | Add Unattended Mode section to SKILL.md | [ ] |
| T002 | Add regression Gherkin feature file | [ ] |
| T003 | Verify no regressions in other skills | [ ] |

### T001: Add Unattended Mode Section to SKILL.md

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] A `## Unattended Mode` section exists after `## When to Use` and before `## What Gets Analyzed`
- [ ] The section explicitly states that `.codex/unattended-mode` does NOT apply to this skill
- [ ] The section instructs Codex to ALWAYS use `interactive prompt` for the review gate
- [ ] Existing unattended-mode notes at Step 9 (line ~222) and Key Rules (line ~279) are preserved
- [ ] No other content in the SKILL.md is changed

**Notes**: Follow the fix strategy from design.md. The section heading and placement must match the structural pattern used by other skills (e.g., `write-spec/SKILL.md` has `## Unattended Mode` after `## When to Use`).

### T002: Add Regression Test

**File(s)**: `specs/46-fix-migrate-project-auto-mode/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Create
**Depends**: T001
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] Gherkin scenario reproduces the original bug condition (unattended-mode present, review gate should still appear)
- [ ] Scenario tagged `@regression`
- [ ] Scenario for the no-unattended-mode path confirms existing behavior preserved
- [ ] Scenario for other skills confirms they still respect unattended-mode

### T003: Verify No Regressions

**File(s)**: Other SDLC skill SKILL.md files
**Type**: Verify (no file changes)
**Depends**: T001, T002
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] `write-spec/SKILL.md` still has its Unattended Mode section unchanged
- [ ] `write-code/SKILL.md` still has its unattended-mode handling unchanged
- [ ] `verify-code/SKILL.md` still has its unattended-mode handling unchanged
- [ ] No other skill SKILL.md files were modified

## Validation Checklist

Before moving to IMPLEMENT phase:

- [x] Tasks are focused on the fix — no feature work
- [x] Regression test is included (T002)
- [x] Each task has verifiable acceptance criteria
- [x] No scope creep beyond the defect
- [x] File paths reference actual project structure (per `structure.md`)
