## Architecture Assessment

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Single Responsibility | 5 | Skill does one thing: create PRs |
| Open/Closed | 4 | PR body template is customizable |
| Liskov Substitution | N/A | No inheritance |
| Interface Segregation | 4 | Reads only the spec files it needs |
| Dependency Inversion | 4 | Depends on spec format abstraction |

### Layer Separation

Simple: read context → generate content → create PR. Clear, linear flow.

### Dependency Flow

Unidirectional: specs + git state → PR body → `gh pr create`.

---

## Security Assessment

- [x] PR creation via authenticated `gh` CLI
- [x] No tokens or secrets in PR body content

---

## Performance Assessment

- [x] Single API call for PR creation
- [x] `disable-model-invocation: true` — deterministic, fast
