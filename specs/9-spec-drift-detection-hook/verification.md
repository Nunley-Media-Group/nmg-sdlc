## Acceptance Criteria Verification

| AC | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| AC1 | Drift detected on file edit | Pass | `hooks/hooks.json:14` — agent prompt checks alignment |
| AC2 | All specs are checked | Pass | `hooks/hooks.json:14` — agent globs all `specs/*/requirements.md` and `specs/*/design.md` |
| AC3 | No-op when no specs exist | Pass | `hooks/hooks.json:10-11` — command gate `ls specs/*/requirements.md` |
| AC4 | Hook fires on Write and Edit | Pass | `hooks/hooks.json:5` — matcher `Write\|Edit` |

## Architecture Assessment

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Single Responsibility | 5 | Hook does one thing: detect spec drift |
| Open/Closed | 5 | Two-layer architecture — gate and agent are independent |
| Liskov Substitution | N/A | No inheritance |
| Interface Segregation | 5 | Command gate and agent hook are separate concerns |
| Dependency Inversion | 5 | Hook depends on spec file format, not specific content |

### Layer Separation

Two clean layers: command gate (fast path) → agent hook (thorough check). Gate prevents unnecessary agent spawning.

### Dependency Flow

Linear: PostToolUse trigger → command gate → agent → JSON response.

---

## Security Assessment

- [x] Agent has read-only access to spec files
- [x] No write operations in the hook chain
- [x] Advisory only — does not block file modifications

---

## Performance Assessment

- [x] Command gate short-circuits instantly when no specs exist
- [x] 60-second timeout prevents infinite agent hangs
- [x] Efficient glob pattern for spec discovery

## Test Coverage

### BDD Scenarios

| Acceptance Criterion | Has Scenario | Has Steps | Passes |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| AC1 — Drift detection | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC2 — All specs checked | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC3 — No-op without specs | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC4 — Write/Edit trigger | Yes | N/A | Yes |

### Coverage Summary

- Feature files: 4 scenarios
- Step definitions: N/A (JSON hook config)

---

## Fixes Applied

None — retroactive verification of shipped feature.

## Remaining Issues

### Critical Issues
None.
### High Priority
None.
### Medium Priority
None.
### Low Priority
None.

---

## Positive Observations

- Two-layer architecture (command gate + agent) is elegant and efficient
- Checking ALL specs (not just current branch) prevents cross-feature drift
- Advisory-only approach avoids blocking developer workflow

---

## Recommendations Summary

### Before PR (Must)
None — feature is shipped.
### Short Term (Should)
None.
### Long Term (Could)
None.
