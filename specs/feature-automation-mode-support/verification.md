## Architecture Assessment

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Single Responsibility | 5 | Unattended-mode is a single cross-cutting concern |
| Open/Closed | 5 | Skills are extended with unattended-mode without changing core logic |
| Liskov Substitution | N/A | No inheritance |
| Interface Segregation | 5 | Each skill handles only its own unattended-mode behavior |
| Dependency Inversion | 5 | Skills depend on abstract flag file, not orchestrator details |

### Layer Separation

Clean cross-cutting pattern: flag file → per-skill behavior modification. No coupling between skills' unattended-mode implementations.

### Dependency Flow

Each skill independently checks the flag file. No inter-skill dependencies for unattended-mode.

---

## Security Assessment

- [x] Unattended-mode requires local file creation (no remote activation)
- [x] All-or-nothing prevents partial automation confusion
- [x] No elevated permissions in unattended-mode

---

## Performance Assessment

- [x] File existence check is sub-millisecond
- [x] Skipping interactive steps makes unattended-mode faster
- [x] No additional overhead when unattended-mode is inactive

## Test Coverage

### BDD Scenarios

| Acceptance Criterion | Has Scenario | Has Steps | Passes |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| AC1 — Headless operation | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC2 — Writing-specs gates | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC3 — Implementing-specs plan | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC4 — Creating-issues inference | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC5 — Starting-issues selection | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC6 — Suppressed suggestions | Yes | N/A | Yes |

### Coverage Summary

- Feature files: 6 scenarios
- Step definitions: N/A (Markdown plugin)

---

## Fixes Applied

None — retroactive verification of shipped feature.

## Remaining Issues

### Critical Issues
None.
### High Priority
None.
### Medium Priority
None.
### Low Priority
None.

---

## Positive Observations

- Skill-level awareness avoids the infinite retry loops that plagued the hook-based approach
- Simple flag file pattern is easy to understand and test
- Consistent "Done. Awaiting orchestrator." signal provides clean handoff for external agents
- Each skill's Unattended Mode section documents exactly what changes, making behavior transparent

### Short Term (Should)
None.
### Long Term (Could)
None.
