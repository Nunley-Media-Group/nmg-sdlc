```
### T[NNN]: [Task Title]

**File(s)**: `{layer}/path/to/file`
**Type**: Create | Modify | Delete
**Depends**: T[NNN], T[NNN] (or None)
**Acceptance**:
- [ ] [Verifiable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Verifiable criterion 2]

**Notes**: [Optional implementation hints]
```

Map `{layer}/` placeholders to actual project paths using `structure.md`.

---

## Phase 1: Setup

### T001: Create migrate-project skill directory

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Create
**Depends**: None
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Directory `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/` exists
- [x] `SKILL.md` file is created (content comes in T002)

---

## Phase 2: Skill Implementation

### T002: Write the SKILL.md for `/migrate-project`

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Create
**Depends**: T001
**Acceptance**:
- [x] SKILL.md follows the standard skill structure (title, When to Use, Workflow steps, Integration with SDLC Workflow)
- [x] Skill is not user-invocable with arguments (no `$ARGUMENTS` — operates on current project)
- [x] Step 1: Resolve template paths — locate `setup-steering/templates/`, `write-spec/templates/`, `scripts/sdlc-config.example.json` from the installed plugin
- [x] Step 2: Scan project files — use `Glob` to find steering docs, spec files, and `sdlc-config.json`
- [x] Step 3: Analyze steering docs — read each template, extract headings from the code block, compare against existing steering docs, identify missing `##`-level sections
- [x] Step 4: Analyze spec files — for each spec directory, detect variant (feature vs defect) by checking first `#` heading, compare against correct template variant, identify missing `##`-level sections
- [x] Step 5: Analyze config — read `sdlc-config.json` and template, identify missing keys at root and `steps` level
- [x] Step 6: Present findings — display per-file summary of proposed additions for interactive review
- [x] Step 7: Apply changes — if approved, use `Edit` to insert missing sections at correct positions; for JSON config, merge missing keys
- [x] Step 8: Output summary — report all changes made
- [x] No unattended-mode support (skill is always interactive)
- [x] Heading extraction instructions explain how to parse template code blocks (content between ` ```markdown ` and ` ``` `)
- [x] Insertion logic instructions explain positioning (insert after the predecessor section in template order)
- [x] Variant detection instructions explain how to identify feature vs defect specs
- [x] JSON merge instructions explain key-level diffing (add missing keys, never overwrite existing values)
- [x] `feature.gherkin` files explicitly excluded from migration
- [x] Includes handling for "already up to date" case
- [x] Includes handling for missing project files (skip, don't create)
- [x] Allowed tools include `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Edit`, `Bash(gh:*)`, `AskUserQuestion`

**Notes**: This is the core deliverable. The SKILL.md must contain clear, unambiguous instructions for Claude to execute the heading-based section diffing algorithm. Include concrete examples of heading extraction, comparison, and insertion. The skill must be self-updating — all template knowledge comes from reading files at runtime, never hardcoded.

---

## Phase 3: Integration

### T003: Update README.md with new skill

**File(s)**: `README.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T002
**Acceptance**:
- [x] `/migrate-project` added to the SDLC Skills table in the Skills Reference section
- [x] Description matches the skill purpose: "Update project specs, steering docs, and configs to latest template standards"

### T004: Update CHANGELOG.md

**File(s)**: `CHANGELOG.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T002
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Entry added under `[Unreleased]` → `### Added` section

- [x] Follows existing changelog style (bold skill name, em-dash, description)

### T005: Bump plugin version (2.6.0 → 2.7.0)

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T002
**Acceptance**:
- [x] `plugins/nmg-sdlc/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `"version"` updated to `"2.7.0"`
- [x] `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → plugin entry `"version"` updated to `"2.7.0"`
- [x] `metadata.version` in `marketplace.json` is NOT changed (it's the collection version)

---

## Phase 4: BDD Testing

- [x] Fallback updated: search `**Issues**` (plural) frontmatter field and fall back to `**Issue**` (singular, legacy)
- [x] Examples show both new (`feature-add-dark-mode-toggle`) and legacy (`42-add-dark-mode-toggle`) patterns

### T011: Add Spec Discovery Section

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/write-spec/SKILL.md`

- [x] Create path: uses `**Issues**: #N` (plural field name, even for first issue), includes initial Change History entry
- [x] Output line updated to note "Write to or amend" the spec file
- [x] Defect variant (bug-labeled issues) always creates new `bug-{slug}` — never amends

**Depends**: T010
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Phase 1 defect variant Related Spec Glob pattern updated to search both `feature-*` and legacy `*` patterns
- [x] Heading detection logic unchanged (still checks for `# Requirements:` vs `# Defect Report:`)

**Depends**: T017
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Step 4c "Cluster Legacy Specs by Feature" describes keyword extraction from directory name and spec content
- [x] Step 4c excludes bug specs (identified by `# Defect Report:` heading) from consolidation grouping
- [x] Step 4c describes proposed feature name derivation: most descriptive slug, prefixed with `feature-`
- [x] Step 4c handles solo specs: single legacy spec → simple rename to `feature-{slug}` (or `bug-{slug}`)
- [x] Step 4d "Present Consolidation Candidates" describes user confirmation via `AskUserQuestion` per group
- [x] Step 4d includes unattended-mode note: **this skill is always interactive — unattended-mode does NOT apply**

**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T018
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Step 4e "Apply Consolidation" describes the full merge process (create dir, merge all spec files, update defect refs, remove legacy dirs)
- [x] Solo renames handled: single legacy spec → new prefix, update `**Issue**` → `**Issues**` frontmatter

- [x] Describes: Glob `feature-*/requirements.md`, `feature-*/design.md`, `feature-*/tasks.md`
- [x] For each file: detect feature variant by heading; skip defect variants
- [x] Detect singular `**Issue**: #N` and propose replacing with `**Issues**: #N`
- [x] Detect missing `## Change History` section and propose adding it with an initial entry
- [x] Defect specs explicitly skipped — they keep singular `**Issue**`

**Depends**: T010
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Prerequisites updated: describes both new `feature-{slug}`/`bug-{slug}` naming and legacy `{issue#}-{slug}` naming

---

## Phase 9: BDD Testing (from #72)

### T025: Create BDD Feature File for Issue #72

**File(s)**: `specs/72-feature-centric-spec-management/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Create
**Depends**: T016, T021, T022, T023

---

## Phase 10: Config Value Drift Detection (from #95)

### T026: Add Value Comparison Logic to Step 5

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T002
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Step 5 is extended with a new sub-step after missing-key detection: "Compare scalar values of all keys present in both project config and template"
- [x] Comparison covers root-level scalar keys (e.g., `model`, `effort`, `maxRetriesPerStep`, `maxBounceRetries`, `maxLogDiskUsageMB`)
- [x] Comparison covers step sub-key scalars (e.g., `steps.createPR.maxTurns`, `steps.verify.timeoutMin`, `steps.implement.model`)
- [x] Complex objects (arrays, nested non-step objects) are explicitly excluded from value comparison
- [x] Keys present in project config but absent from template are skipped (user additions, per FR32)
- [x] Each drifted value is recorded with: dotted key path, current project value, template default value

**Notes**: This task modifies the existing Step 5 instructions. The missing-key logic remains unchanged — drift detection is an additive pass that runs after missing-key identification.

### T027: Add Config Value Drift to Step 9 Summary and Approval Flow

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T026
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Step 9 migration summary gains a new "Config Value Drift" category showing drifted values with current → template format
- [x] In interactive mode, a new "Part C" approval step is added after Part B: `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` listing each drifted value as a selectable option
- [x] Each option label shows the dotted key path and values (e.g., `steps.createPR.maxTurns: 15 → 30`)
- [x] Each option description provides brief context (e.g., the key's purpose)
- [x] If no drift is found, Part C is skipped
- [x] Unselected values are left unchanged (not recorded as declined or persisted)

### T028: Add Auto-Mode Drift Reporting Behavior

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T027
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Unattended Mode section updated: drift is reported in summary but NOT applied when `.claude/unattended-mode` exists
- [x] Drift values are NOT recorded in the "Skipped Operations" block (they are informational, not deferred destructive operations)
- [x] The "Non-destructive" and "Destructive" classification lists mention config value drift as neither — it is an informational-only category in unattended-mode
- [x] Step 9 unattended-mode path skips Part C (no approval prompt, no application)

### T029: Add Drift Update Application to Step 10

**File(s)**: `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/migrate-project/SKILL.md`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T027
**Acceptance**:
- [x] Step 10 apply procedures gain a new item for config value drift updates
- [x] Instructions: for each user-selected drifted value, use `Edit` to replace the old value with the template default in `sdlc-config.json`
- [x] JSON formatting must be preserved (2-space indentation)
- [x] The "Key Rules" section is updated: a new rule clarifies that value updates are an exception to "never overwrite values" — they require explicit per-value user approval
- [x] The "What Gets Analyzed" section is updated to mention config value drift

---

## Phase 11: BDD Testing (from #95)

### T030: Append BDD Scenarios for Config Value Drift Detection

**File(s)**: `specs/feature-migration-skill/feature.gherkin`
**Type**: Modify
**Depends**: T026, T027, T028, T029
**Acceptance**:
- [x] All 5 acceptance criteria from issue #95 (AC25–AC29) have corresponding Gherkin scenarios
- [x] Scenarios appended at the end of the existing feature file
- [x] Tagged with `# Added by issue #95` comment
- [x] Uses Given/When/Then format
- [x] Covers: drift detection, nested step values, per-value approval, approved/declined updates, unattended-mode behavior
