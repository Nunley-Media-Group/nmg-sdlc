# Requirements: Writing Specs Skill

**Issues**: #5, #16
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Codex (retroactive)

---

## User Story

**As a** developer working on a GitHub issue,
**I want** an automated 3-phase specification process that produces requirements, design, and task breakdown documents,
**So that** implementation is guided by well-structured BDD specs rather than ad-hoc interpretation of issue descriptions.

---

## Background

The `/write-spec` skill reads a GitHub issue and generates three specification documents through sequential phases: (1) Requirements spec — captures what needs to be built with acceptance criteria and functional requirements, (2) Design spec — defines the technical approach with architecture decisions and component design, and (3) Tasks spec — breaks the design into ordered implementation tasks with file-level granularity and Gherkin feature scenarios. Each phase has a human review gate (skipped in unattended mode) where the developer can request changes before proceeding. Specs are written to `specs/{feature-name}/` using a naming algorithm derived from the issue number and title. For bug issues (detected via `bug` label), all three phases use lighter defect-focused templates.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Requirements Spec Captures Issue Intent

**Given** I invoke `/write-spec` with a GitHub issue reference
**When** Phase 1 completes
**Then** a requirements spec is created in `specs/{feature-name}/` with acceptance criteria from the issue

### AC2: Design Spec Defines Technical Approach

**Given** the requirements spec has been reviewed and approved
**When** Phase 2 completes
**Then** a design spec is created with architecture decisions, component design, and technology choices

### AC3: Tasks Spec Provides Implementation Plan

**Given** the design spec has been reviewed and approved
**When** Phase 3 completes
**Then** a tasks spec is created with ordered implementation tasks and Gherkin feature scenarios

### AC4: Human Review Gates Pause Between Phases

**Given** I am not in unattended mode
**When** a phase completes
**Then** the skill pauses for human review before proceeding to the next phase

### AC5: Feature Name Follows Naming Convention

**Given** a GitHub issue with number and title
**When** the feature name is derived
**Then** it uses the format `{issue-number}-{kebab-case-slug}` (e.g., `42-user-auth`)

### AC6: Bug Issues Use Defect Templates

**Given** the GitHub issue has a `bug` label
**When** the spec phases execute
**Then** defect-focused templates are used with reproduction steps, root cause analysis, and flat task lists

<!-- From issue #16 -->

### AC7: Bug Label Triggers Defect Templates Across All Skills

**Given** a GitHub issue has the `bug` label
**When** any SDLC skill processes the issue
**Then** defect-focused template variants are used instead of feature templates

### AC8: Bug Report Captures Reproduction Steps

**Given** I'm creating an issue for a bug via `/draft-issue`
**When** the bug report template is used
**Then** it includes reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior, environment table, and defect-focused acceptance criteria

### AC9: Defect Specs Use Root Cause Analysis

**Given** `/write-spec` runs for a bug issue
**When** the design phase executes
**Then** it uses the defect design variant with root cause analysis, fix strategy, blast radius assessment, and regression risk

### AC10: Defect Tasks Are Flat and Minimal

**Given** `/write-spec` runs for a bug issue
**When** the tasks phase executes
**Then** it produces a flat T001-T003 task list (fix, test, verify) instead of a full task hierarchy

### AC11: Implementation Minimizes Change Scope

**Given** `/write-code` runs for a bug fix
**When** implementation begins
**Then** it follows the fix strategy precisely, minimizes change scope, and requires a regression test

### AC12: Verification Checks Regression Scenarios

**Given** `/verify-code` runs for a bug fix
**When** verification executes
**Then** it checks reproduction, validates `@regression` Gherkin scenarios, audits blast radius, and confirms minimal change

### AC13: Related Spec Field Links to Original Feature

**Given** a defect spec is for a bug in a previously-specified feature
**When** the requirements spec is written
**Then** it can include an optional "Related Spec" field referencing the original feature spec
