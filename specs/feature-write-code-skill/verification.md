## Architecture Assessment

### SOLID Compliance

| Principle | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Single Responsibility | 5 | Skill does one thing: execute spec-defined tasks |
| Open/Closed | 4 | Supports feature and bug fix modes without modification |
| Liskov Substitution | N/A | No inheritance |
| Interface Segregation | 4 | Steps are independent and well-scoped |
| Dependency Inversion | 4 | Depends on spec format abstraction, not specific content |

### Layer Separation

Clean separation: spec reading → planning → execution → reporting. Each step is distinct.

### Dependency Flow

Linear: specs → steering docs → plan mode → task execution → completion signal.

---

## Security Assessment

- [x] Code generation follows project conventions from steering docs
- [x] No arbitrary command execution outside allowed tools
- [x] Spec-driven scope prevents unauthorized changes

---

## Performance Assessment

- [x] Sequential task execution avoids conflicts
- [x] Resumable from last incomplete task
- [x] Spec files are small Markdown, fast to read

## Test Coverage

### BDD Scenarios

| Acceptance Criterion | Has Scenario | Has Steps | Passes |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| AC1 — Specs read first | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC2 — Plan mode | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC3 — Sequential tasks | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC4 — Bug fix | Yes | N/A | Yes |
| AC5 — Unattended-mode | Yes | N/A | Yes |

### Coverage Summary

- Feature files: 5 scenarios
- Step definitions: N/A (Markdown plugin)

---

## Fixes Applied

None — retroactive verification of shipped feature.

## Remaining Issues

### Critical Issues
None.
### High Priority
None.
### Medium Priority
None.
### Low Priority
None.

---

## Positive Observations

- Comprehensive deviation handling (minor, major, blocker escalation paths)
- Resume capability for partially completed implementations
- Clear separation between planning and execution phases

---

## Recommendations Summary

### Before PR (Must)
None — feature is shipped.
### Short Term (Should)
None.
### Long Term (Could)
None.
