# Requirements: Implementing Specs Skill

**Issues**: #6
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Claude Code (retroactive)

---

## User Story

**As a** developer with completed specs for a feature,
**I want** a skill that reads my specs, creates an implementation plan, and executes tasks sequentially,
**So that** I can implement features methodically by following the spec-defined task order rather than improvising.

---

## Background

The `/write-code` skill bridges the gap between specification and code. It reads the requirements, design, and tasks specs from `specs/{feature-name}/`, enters plan mode to design the implementation approach (getting user approval before writing code), then executes each task from the tasks spec sequentially. The skill uses Glob to locate spec files when the feature name is ambiguous. In unattended mode, plan mode is skipped and approval gates are bypassed. For bug fixes, the skill follows the fix strategy precisely, minimizes change scope, and requires a regression test.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Specs Are Read Before Implementation

**Given** I invoke `/write-code` with a feature name
**When** the skill starts
**Then** it reads all spec files from `specs/{feature-name}/` before any code changes

### AC2: Plan Mode Gets Approval Before Coding

**Given** specs have been read in interactive mode
**When** the skill enters plan mode
**Then** the implementation plan is presented for user approval before any code is written

### AC3: Tasks Execute Sequentially

**Given** the implementation plan is approved
**When** implementation begins
**Then** tasks from the tasks spec are executed in order, one at a time

### AC4: Bug Fixes Follow Fix Strategy

**Given** the spec is for a bug fix
**When** implementation begins
**Then** the skill follows the fix strategy precisely, minimizes change scope, and includes a regression test

### AC5: Unattended Mode Skips Plan Approval

**Given** unattended mode is active
**When** the skill runs
**Then** plan mode is skipped and tasks execute without approval gates

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|-------|
| FR1 | Read specs from `specs/{feature-name}/` directory | Must | requirements, design, tasks, gherkin |
| FR2 | Enter plan mode with implementation approach for user approval | Must | Via EnterPlanMode tool |
| FR3 | Sequential task execution following the tasks spec order | Must | One task at a time |
| FR4 | Glob-based spec file discovery when feature name is ambiguous | Must | Fallback discovery |
| FR5 | Automation mode support skipping plan mode and approval gates | Must | `.claude/unattended-mode` check |
| FR6 | Bug fix mode with minimal change scope and regression test requirement | Must | Defect spec handling |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Each task executes within normal Claude Code session limits |
| **Security** | Generated code follows security best practices from steering docs |
| **Reliability** | Partial implementation can be resumed from the last incomplete task |

## UI/UX Requirements

Reference `structure.md` and `product.md` for project-specific design standards.

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Interaction** | [Touch targets, gesture requirements] |
| **Typography** | [Minimum text sizes, font requirements] |
| **Contrast** | [Accessibility contrast requirements] |
| **Loading States** | [How loading should be displayed] |
| **Error States** | [How errors should be displayed] |
| **Empty States** | [How empty data should be displayed] |
