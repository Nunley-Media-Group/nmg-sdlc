# Onboard Project

Single entry point for adopting nmg-sdlc on a project that isn't already spec-driven. Detects whether the project is **greenfield** (no code, no specs), **brownfield** (existing code and closed issues but no specs), or **already-initialized**, then routes work accordingly. Brownfield projects get one spec directory per reconciled feature, synthesized from closed GitHub issues, merged PR diffs, commit messages, and the current implementation.

This skill **delegates rather than duplicates**:

- Steering doc bootstrap → `/setup-steering`
- Runner config generation → `/init-config`
- Template drift on already-initialized projects → `/upgrade-project`
- Spec template structure → read from `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/write-spec/templates/`

Its own responsibility is mode detection, brownfield reconciliation, post-reconciliation verification, and the final summary.

## When to Use

- First-time adoption of nmg-sdlc in a brand-new project
- First-time adoption in an existing codebase that already has shipped features and closed issues
- When you need specs reverse-engineered from the historical record so the SDLC pipeline has something to consume

## When NOT to Use

- To write a spec for a new feature (use `/write-spec`)
- To update existing specs to current templates (use `/upgrade-project`)
- To create GitHub issues or PRs (use `/draft-issue` or `/open-pr`)

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status` passes) — required for brownfield reconciliation
- Git-initialized repository
- Claude Code plugin `nmg-sdlc` installed at current version

## Mode Detection Matrix

| `steering/` exists | `specs/` has specs | Source files beyond scaffold | Closed issues exist | Mode |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|------|
| Any | **Yes** | Any | Any | **Already initialized** |
| No | No | No | No | **Greenfield** |
| Yes | No | No | No | **Greenfield** (steering pre-seeded) |
| Any | No | **Yes** | Yes | **Brownfield** |
| Any | No | Yes | **No** | **Brownfield-no-issues** (empty state — offer to treat as greenfield) |

**Scaffold allowlist** (files that do NOT count as source): `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `LICENSE.txt`.

**Exclude from file count**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, and any hidden directory (names starting with `.`).

## Unattended Mode

If `.claude/unattended-mode` exists:

- All `AskUserQuestion` prompts are skipped — the skill proceeds with defaults
- Consolidation groups are auto-accepted as proposed
- `/init-config` invocation after greenfield bootstrap is auto-yes
- Already-initialized mode auto-delegates to `/upgrade-project`
- Every auto-decision (which groups were accepted, which defaults were applied) is logged in the final summary so the run can be audited

## Workflow

### Step 0: Legacy-Layout Precondition

Run `Glob` for:

- `.claude/steering/*.md`
- `.claude/specs/*/requirements.md`

If either returns a match, abort and print:

```
ERROR: This project uses the legacy `.claude/steering/` and/or `.claude/specs/` directory layout, which current Claude Code releases refuse to write to. Run `/upgrade-project` first, then re-run `/onboard-project`.
```

This gate fires in both interactive and unattended mode.

### Step 1: Detect Mode

Gather four signals:

1. **`steering/` presence** — `Glob` for `steering/product.md`, `steering/tech.md`, `steering/structure.md`
2. **`specs/` presence** — `Glob` for `specs/*/requirements.md`
3. **Source-file count beyond scaffold** — list tracked files via `git ls-files`, exclude the scaffold allowlist and hidden/excluded directories, count the remainder
4. **Closed-issue presence** — `gh issue list --state closed --limit 1 --json number` (one-item probe, just to detect whether any exist)

Classify per the Mode Detection Matrix. Print a one-line summary of the detected mode and the evidence used, e.g.:

```
Brownfield detected: 12 closed issues, 47 source files, no specs/.
```

Store the evidence for the Step 5 summary. Proceed to the branch matching the detected mode.

### Step 2G: Greenfield — Steering Bootstrap

1. Invoke `/setup-steering` (delegated) and wait for it to return.
2. Verify `steering/product.md`, `steering/tech.md`, and `steering/structure.md` all exist. If any is missing, record as a gap and abort (do not continue to Step 3G). The gap appears in the Step 5 summary.
3. Proceed to Step 3G.

### Step 3G: Greenfield — Optional Init-Config

1. In interactive mode, call `AskUserQuestion` asking whether to run `/init-config` now for unattended-runner setup. Options: `[1] Yes — run /init-config now`, `[2] No — skip, I'll run it later`.
2. In unattended mode, auto-yes without prompting. Log the auto-decision.
3. If yes, invoke `/init-config` (delegated) and record its exit status.
4. Jump to Step 5 (Summary). Greenfield does not reconcile specs.

### Step 2I: Already-Initialized — Route to /upgrade-project

1. List the existing spec directories under `specs/` so the user can audit what is already present.
2. In interactive mode, call `AskUserQuestion`: `[1] Delegate to /upgrade-project now`, `[2] Exit without changes`.
3. In unattended mode, auto-accept option 1. Log the auto-decision.
4. On accept, invoke `/upgrade-project` (delegated) and exit after it returns — jump to Step 5 summary.
5. On decline, exit cleanly — jump to Step 5 summary with no specs modified.
6. This branch MUST NOT read, modify, or overwrite any existing spec file.

### Step 2B: Brownfield — Preflight

1. Run `gh auth status`. If it fails, abort with a clear message pointing the user at `gh auth login` — do not proceed to reconciliation.
2. If `steering/` is missing or incomplete (fewer than all three of `product.md`, `tech.md`, `structure.md`), delegate to `/setup-steering` first (AC5). After it returns, re-verify all three files exist before continuing. If still incomplete, record a gap and abort.
3. Handle the **brownfield-no-issues** empty state: if the mode-detection step found zero closed issues, report "brownfield detected but zero closed issues" and offer (via `AskUserQuestion`, auto-accept in unattended mode) to treat the project as greenfield-plus-existing-code. On accept, route to Step 3G. On decline, jump to Step 5 summary with no reconciliation performed.
4. Read the four `/write-spec` template files from `plugins/nmg-sdlc/skills/write-spec/templates/`:
   - `requirements.md` — contains both the full feature variant and the lightweight "Defect Requirements Variant" (search for the `# Defect Requirements Variant` heading to locate the defect section)
   - `design.md`
   - `tasks.md` — contains both the phased feature task layout and the flat "Defect Tasks Variant"
   - `feature.gherkin`

   Store their contents in memory for synthesis. Reading templates at runtime — rather than embedding their structure here — keeps this skill aligned with future `/write-spec` template changes automatically. When synthesizing a defect spec, use the Defect variant sections from `requirements.md` and `tasks.md`; for feature specs, use the full variants.

5. Proceed to Step 3B.

### Step 3B: Brownfield — Reconciliation Loop

#### 3B.1 Fetch Closed Issues

```
gh issue list --state closed --json number,title,body,labels,closedAt --limit 500
```

Pre-filter at the CLI (`--state closed`) — do not fetch all issues and filter client-side. Skip any issue closed with reason `duplicate`, `not planned`, or having a `wontfix` label — these yield no useful design evidence; record them in the summary as "skipped (no actionable evidence)".

**Pagination note**: `--limit 500` is a hard ceiling. If the repository has more than 500 closed issues, the output is silently truncated. Note this in the summary ("Fetched N closed issues; repository may have additional issues beyond the 500-issue limit — re-run with `--search` or `--since` filtering to target a subset.").

Emit progress every ~5 issues so long runs are observable.

#### 3B.2 Per-Issue Evidence Gathering

For each remaining issue, in this order (AC9):

1. **Issue body + comments** — `gh issue view N --json body,comments`
2. **Merged PR** — `gh issue view N --json closedByPullRequestsReferences` to find the PR number; then `gh pr view <prnum> --json body,files,commits,merged` (only if `merged` is true)
3. **PR diff** — `gh pr diff <prnum>`
4. **Commit messages** — from the `commits[].messageHeadline` field in the PR JSON
5. **Current implementation files** — for each path in `pr.files[].path`, use `Glob`/`Read` to confirm presence in the working tree

Build the evidence set in memory for this issue. **Discard** the prior issue's evidence before beginning the next — no inter-iteration state leakage.

If no merged PR is found (`NO_PR`), degrade per AC10: keep only evidence sources #1 and #5, mark this spec for a `## Known Gaps` section noting missing PR context, and continue processing remaining issues. A single reconciliation gap must NOT abort the run.

#### 3B.3 Template Variant Selection (AC4)

Per issue:

1. If the issue carries a `bug` label → defect template.
2. Else, inspect the title + body for any of these keywords (case-insensitive): `fix`, `bug`, `broken`, `regression`, `crash`, `error`. If any match → defect template.
3. Otherwise → feature template.

Feature specs emit to `specs/feature-{slug}/`; defect specs emit to `specs/bug-{slug}/`.

#### 3B.4 Consolidation Grouping

After all issues are classified:

1. Group issues that share a non-trivial label (excluding `enhancement`, `bug`, `automatable`, `good-first-issue` and other pipeline-mechanical labels).
2. Additionally group by Jaccard overlap ≥ 0.3 on title tokens, after stop-word filtering (`the`, `a`, `an`, `add`, `fix`, `update`, `remove`, `for`, `to`, `of`, `and`, `or`).
3. Merge overlapping groups transitively (if issue A groups with B and B groups with C, A/B/C form one group).
4. For each group with ≥ 2 issues, present a consolidation proposal via `AskUserQuestion`:

   ```
   Issues #10, #14, #27 share the label "dark-mode" and overlapping keywords ("toggle", "theme").
   Consolidate into one spec?
   [1] Yes — produce one consolidated feature-{slug}/ with all three issue numbers
   [2] No — produce one spec per issue
   ```

5. In unattended mode, auto-accept consolidation (option 1) and log each auto-decision for the summary.
6. Single-issue "groups" (no consolidation candidates) proceed directly to synthesis with no prompt.

#### 3B.5 Per-Spec Synthesis

For each approved group (or single issue):

1. **Slugify** the title using strict allowlist `[a-z0-9-]`, collapsing runs of non-allowlisted characters to a single hyphen, trimming leading/trailing hyphens, and capping at 60 characters. This is a security boundary — issue content is untrusted.
2. **Check for collision** (FR16) — if `specs/feature-{slug}/` or `specs/bug-{slug}/` already exists, skip synthesis and record "skipped — spec dir already exists" for the summary.
3. **Synthesize all four files in memory** using the templates loaded in Step 2B.4:
   - **`requirements.md`** — fill user story, background, acceptance criteria, FRs from issue body + PR body. Frontmatter `**Issues**: #N, #M, ...` listing every contributing issue number.
   - **`design.md`** — fill overview, architecture, API/interface changes from PR diff + PR body + commit messages + current code. Include an explicit `## Evidence Sources` section listing which of {issue body, PR body, PR diff, commit messages, current code} contributed to each major section (AC9). If the issue degraded per AC10, include a `## Known Gaps` section noting the missing PR.
   - **`tasks.md`** — reverse-engineer phased tasks from PR commits; mark each as complete (`[x]`) since the code has landed. Map each task to the actual files in `pr.files[].path`.
   - **`feature.gherkin`** — derive scenarios from the reconstructed ACs in `requirements.md`. For defect specs, tag each scenario with `@regression` (required by `/verify-code`'s bug-fix verification contract).

4. Embed any diff snippets, PR body excerpts, issue body text, or issue comments inside fenced code blocks — never interpolate untrusted content into Markdown headings or into shell commands. Issue body and comments are user-controlled input and must be treated as untrusted throughout.
5. **If `--dry-run` was passed**, do NOT write files — record "would produce specs/..." for the summary and continue.
6. Otherwise, `Write` all four files in sequence. If any `Write` fails mid-sequence, record the partial directory as a gap (no rollback — see design.md). In the summary, include the instruction: "To re-reconcile this issue, manually delete `specs/{slug}/` before re-running `/onboard-project`."

### Step 4: Post-Reconciliation Verification

For each spec directory produced in this run (greenfield skips this step — nothing to verify):

1. Verify all four files exist: `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `feature.gherkin`. Any missing file is a gap recorded for the summary (AC8).
2. Extract referenced file paths from each `design.md`: scan all inline code spans (`` `path/to/file.ext` ``) and fenced code block content within the `## Architecture`, `## API / Interface Changes`, and `## Tasks` sections for tokens matching the pattern `[\w./\-]+\.\w+` (i.e., strings with at least one dot that look like file paths). For each extracted path, use `Glob` or `Read` to confirm the file exists in the current working tree. Missing files are gaps — the spec is still kept on disk, not deleted.
3. Verification MUST NOT abort the run on gaps — it records them for Step 5.

### Step 5: Summary Report

Emit a structured summary with these sections:

1. **Mode detected** — greenfield, brownfield, already-initialized, or brownfield-no-issues
2. **Delegated skills invoked** — each of `/setup-steering`, `/init-config`, `/upgrade-project` that ran, with success/failure status
3. **Specs produced** — every spec directory written this run, with contributing issue numbers in parentheses, e.g.:

   ```
   specs/feature-dark-mode/        (#10, #14, #27)
   specs/bug-login-crash-on-timeout/ (#42)
   specs/feature-export-report/    (#61) — partial: ## Known Gaps noted
   ```

4. **Skipped** — issues skipped as `duplicate`/`wontfix`/`not planned`, and spec dirs skipped because they already existed (FR16)
5. **Gaps** — any missing artifact files (from Step 4), any referenced source files that no longer exist in the working tree (including every reconciled spec that references behavior no longer present in the current implementation), and any partial spec directories from Write failures
6. **Auto-decisions** (unattended-mode runs only) — every consolidation auto-accept, every default applied without prompting
7. **Review reminder** — one line reminding the user that reconciled specs may contain internal URLs, reproduction data, or other content copied from closed issues and should be reviewed before committing
8. **Next step** —
   - Greenfield: `Run /draft-issue to create your first issue.`
   - Brownfield: `Review the reconciled specs, then run /draft-issue for new work or /upgrade-project to bring reconciled specs up to the latest templates.`
   - Already-initialized (after `/upgrade-project`): `Run /draft-issue for the next feature.`

If `.claude/unattended-mode` exists, replace the "Next step" with `Done. Awaiting orchestrator.`

## Error States

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Legacy `.claude/steering/` or `.claude/specs/` layout detected | Abort in Step 0 with upgrade instructions |
| `gh auth status` fails in brownfield mode | Abort in Step 2B with `gh auth login` pointer |
| `/setup-steering` delegation returns incomplete | Abort before reconciliation; gap recorded for summary |
| Single issue fails reconciliation | Recorded as gap; run continues (AC10/FR13) |
| Spec dir already exists at target slug | Skipped, recorded in summary (FR16) |
| Spec references removed source file | Spec still written; gap recorded in summary (AC8) |

---

## Integration with SDLC Workflow

This is the one-time adoption step for projects that aren't yet spec-driven. It runs before `/draft-issue` and produces the artifacts the pipeline depends on (`steering/` docs and, for brownfield, a seed population of specs).
