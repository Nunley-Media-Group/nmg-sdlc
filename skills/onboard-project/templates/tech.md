# Technical Steering Template

Generate this document during `/onboard-project` (Step 2G.3 — steering bootstrap). Pre-fill the tech stack, testing, and coding standards from codebase analysis.

# [Project Name] Technical Steering

This document defines the technology stack, constraints, and integration standards.
All technical decisions should align with these guidelines.

## Versioning

<!-- Pre-fill VERSION from the project root if it exists. -->

The `VERSION` file (plain text semver at project root) is the **single source of truth** for the project's current version. Stack-specific files (e.g., `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pubspec.yaml`) are kept in sync via the mapping table below.

<!-- TODO: Fill in the stack-specific files that contain a version field. -->
<!-- The /open-pr skill reads this table to know which files to update when bumping the version. -->

| File | Path | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| [file] | [path-to-version-field] | [e.g., "npm version field"] |

### Path Syntax

- **JSON files**: Use dot-notation (e.g., `version` for a root-level key, `packages.mylib.version` for nested)
- **TOML files**: Use dot-notation matching TOML keys (e.g., `package.version`)
- **Plain text files**: Use `line:N` for the line number containing the version, or omit Path if the entire file is the version string

### Version Bump Classification

The `/open-pr` skill and the `sdlc-runner.mjs` deterministic bump postcondition both read this table to classify version bumps. Modify this table to change the classification rules — no skill or script changes are needed.

<!-- TODO: Add or modify label→bump mappings to match your project's labeling conventions. -->

| Label | Bump Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `bug` | patch | Bug fix — backwards-compatible |
| `enhancement` | minor | New feature — backwards-compatible |

**Default**: If an issue's labels do not match any row, the bump type is **minor**.

**Major bumps are manual-only.** They are never triggered by labels, milestones, or breaking changes. A developer must opt in explicitly via `/open-pr #N --major`; the SDLC runner will not apply a major bump. In unattended mode, `--major` escalates and exits without bumping — major-version bumps are a deliberate release decision that a headless runner cannot make on a human's behalf.

**Breaking changes use minor bumps.** A `### Changed (BREAKING)` sub-section in a CHANGELOG version entry does NOT override the bump type. Communicate the breaking nature via a `**BREAKING CHANGE:**` bold prefix on the affected bullet, and (recommended) add a `### Migration Notes` sub-section to the entry. Example:

```markdown
## [1.50.0] - 2026-04-19

### Changed (BREAKING)

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Renamed `foo()` to `bar()`; update callers accordingly.

### Migration Notes

Replace any calls to `foo(x)` with `bar(x)` — the signature is otherwise unchanged.
```

## Technical Constraints

### Performance

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| [metric] | [target] | [why] |

### Security

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Authentication | [method] |
| Authorization | [method] |

## Coding Standards

<!-- Pre-fill from linter/formatter config if detected -->

### [Primary Language]

```
// GOOD patterns from this project
[example of project convention]

// BAD patterns to avoid
[counter-example]
```

### [Secondary Language] (if applicable)

```
// GOOD patterns
[example]

// BAD patterns
[counter-example]
```

---

## API / Interface Standards

<!-- Pre-fill if API conventions are discoverable -->

### URL/Method Structure

```
[project's API convention, e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC]
```

### Response Format

```json
// Success response format
{
  "example": "from existing code"
}

// Error response format
{
  "error": "from existing code"
}
```

---

## Database Standards

<!-- Pre-fill if database conventions are discoverable -->

### Naming

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Tables | [convention] | [example] |
| Columns | [convention] | [example] |
| Primary keys | [convention] | [example] |

---

## Testing Standards

### BDD Testing (Required for nmg-sdlc)

**Every acceptance criterion MUST have a Gherkin test.**

<!-- TODO: Fill in your BDD framework details. This is critical for /write-spec and /verify-code. -->

| Layer | Framework | Location |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| [layer] | [BDD framework] | [path to feature files] |

### Gherkin Feature Files

```gherkin
# [path to feature files]
Feature: Example
  As a [user type]
  I want [action]
  So that [benefit]

  Scenario: Example scenario
    Given [precondition]
    When [action]
    Then [expected outcome]
```

### Step Definitions

```
// [language] step definition pattern
// Path: [path to step definitions]

// Adapt to your BDD framework:
// - jest-cucumber (JavaScript/TypeScript)
// - pytest-bdd (Python)
// - SpecFlow (C#)
// - godog (Go)
// - flutter_gherkin (Dart)
// - Cucumber (Java/Ruby)
```

### Unit Tests

<!-- Pre-fill from discovered test framework -->

| Type | Framework | Location | Run Command |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Unit | [framework] | [path] | [command] |
| Integration | [framework] | [path] | [command] |
| E2E | [framework] | [path] | [command] |

### Test Pyramid

```
        /\
       /  \  BDD Integration (Gherkin)
      /----\  - Acceptance criteria as tests
     /      \ - End-to-end user flows
    /--------\
   /          \  Component / API Tests
  /            \ - Component behavior
 /--------------\
/                \  Unit Tests
 \________________/ - Business logic
```

## Verification Gates

Declare mandatory verification steps that `/verify-code` enforces as hard gates. Each gate specifies when it applies, what command to run, and how to determine success.

<!-- TODO: Define project-specific verification gates. Remove or replace the example rows below. -->

| Gate | Condition | Action | Pass Criteria |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Unit Tests | Always | `npm test` | Exit code 0 |
| E2E Tests | `e2e/` directory exists | `npm run test:e2e` | Exit code 0 |
| Integration Tests | `*.integration.test.*` files exist in `tests/` | `npm run test:integration` | Exit code 0 AND `coverage/lcov.info` file generated |

### Condition Evaluation Rules

- `Always` — gate always applies
- `{path} directory exists` — gate applies only when the directory is present (`test -d {path}`)
- `{glob} files exist in {path}` — gate applies only when matching files are found in the given path

If no `## Verification Gates` section exists in `tech.md`, no gates are enforced (backward-compatible).

### Pass Criteria Evaluation Rules

- `Exit code 0` — the Action command must exit with code 0
- `{file} file generated` — the named file must exist after the Action command completes (artifact verification)
- `output contains "{text}"` — stdout or stderr must contain the specified text
- Compound criteria use `AND` — all sub-criteria must be satisfied (e.g., `Exit code 0 AND report.xml file generated`)
- The verify-code skill evaluates these textual criteria against actual results — no stack-specific logic is needed
