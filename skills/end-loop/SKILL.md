# End Loop

Tear down unattended mode and clear SDLC runner state. This is the explicit counterpart to `/run-loop`: one command to stop the loop cleanly, whether the runner is live, crashed, or already gone.

The runner artifacts this skill manages mirror `RUNNER_ARTIFACTS` in `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs:566` and the delete-best-effort semantics of `removeUnattendedMode()` in `scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs:614`. If those locations change, this skill needs a corresponding update.

## When to Use

- Stopping an active SDLC loop mid-cycle to return to interactive work
- Cleaning up after a crashed runner that left stale `.codex/unattended-mode` or `.codex/sdlc-state.json`
- Idempotent "make sure unattended mode is off" invocation

## Runner Artifacts

The skill operates on exactly two paths, relative to the project root:

- `.codex/unattended-mode` — flag file signalling headless operation
- `.codex/sdlc-state.json` — runner state (may contain a `runnerPid` field)

## Step 1: Check for `.codex/` Directory

```bash
test -d .codex
```

If the directory does not exist, this is not a runner project. Emit exactly:

```
Not a runner project — no .codex directory found.
```

Exit 0. Do not proceed.

## Step 2: Check for Either Artifact

```bash
test -e .codex/unattended-mode || test -e .codex/sdlc-state.json
```

If neither file exists, unattended mode is already disabled. Emit exactly:

```
Unattended mode already disabled — nothing to do.
```

Exit 0. Do not proceed.

## Step 3: Extract `runnerPid` from State (If Present)

If `.codex/sdlc-state.json` exists, attempt to parse it and extract `runnerPid`.

Use the Read tool to load the file contents. Then validate:

1. The file contents parse as JSON.
2. The parsed object has a `runnerPid` field.
3. `runnerPid` is a **positive integer** (`typeof === 'number'`, `Number.isInteger`, `> 0`).

If any of these checks fail — malformed JSON, missing field, non-integer, zero, or negative — skip PID extraction silently. Do not raise a parse error. Treat the file as opaque and continue to Step 6.

**Security note**: the positive-integer check is load-bearing. Negative or non-integer values must never be passed to `process.kill` (e.g., `process.kill(-1, 'SIGTERM')` would broadcast to the entire process group).

## Step 4: Liveness Probe (If Valid PID Extracted)

With a validated positive integer PID, check whether the process is live:

```bash
node -e "try { process.kill(<PID>, 0); } catch { process.exit(1); }"
```

Substitute `<PID>` with the exact integer captured in Step 3. Do not interpolate any other value from the state file into this command.

- Exit code 0 → process is alive → proceed to Step 5.
- Exit code 1 → process is dead (or unreachable) → skip signalling silently and proceed to Step 6. Do not emit anything to stdout or stderr.

## Step 5: Send SIGTERM (If Live)

```bash
node -e "try { process.kill(<PID>, 'SIGTERM'); } catch (e) { console.error(e.code || e.message); process.exit(1); }"
```

Substitute `<PID>` with the exact integer captured in Step 3. Do not interpolate any other value from the state file into this command.

- Success (exit code 0) → record "Signalled runner PID `<PID>` (SIGTERM)" for the summary.
- Failure (non-zero exit) → the command writes a clean error token (e.g., `EPERM`) to stderr. Capture stderr as `<reason>` and record "Failed to signal PID `<PID>`: `<reason>`" for the summary. **Continue to Step 6** — partial cleanup is preferable to no cleanup.

Do not wait for the process to exit. SIGTERM is fire-and-forget.

## Step 6: Delete Artifacts

Remove both files with best-effort semantics. `rm -f` does not error on missing files.

```bash
rm -f .codex/unattended-mode
rm -f .codex/sdlc-state.json
```

If either `rm` exits non-zero **and** the file still exists (check with `test -e`), the deletion failed for a reason other than the file being absent — typically `EACCES`. Capture the specific file path and the OS-level reason. After attempting both deletions, if any deletion failed, emit:

```
Failed to remove <path>: <OS reason>
```

to stderr and exit non-zero. The specific file path in the error message is required so the developer can resolve the permission issue manually.

For each file that was present before the `rm` and is no longer present after, record "Removed `<path>`" for the summary.

## Step 7: Emit Summary

Output format depends on what happened in the preceding steps.

### Happy path — no errors

```
Stopped unattended mode.
  Signalled runner PID <PID> (SIGTERM)
  Removed .codex/unattended-mode
  Removed .codex/sdlc-state.json
```

Omit the "Signalled" line if no live PID was found (dead PID, malformed state, or state file absent). Omit any "Removed" line for a file that was not present.

### Partial failure — SIGTERM denied but files deleted

```
Stopped unattended mode (with warnings).
  Failed to signal PID <PID>: <reason>
  Removed .codex/unattended-mode
  Removed .codex/sdlc-state.json
```

### Deletion failure

Already handled in Step 6 — a deletion failure exits non-zero with a specific-file error on stderr.

## Unattended Mode

This skill always runs non-interactively. It does not call `request_user_input`, does not enter plan mode, and does not gate on any user confirmation. Invocation under `.codex/unattended-mode` behaves identically to invocation without it — which matters because a common use case is to disable unattended mode that the skill itself is currently running under.

## Integration with SDLC Workflow

`/end-loop` pairs with `/run-loop` as the explicit stop command:

```
/run-loop           →  Starts the SDLC pipeline (creates .codex/unattended-mode + state)
/end-loop           →  Stops the pipeline (signals runner, removes both files)
```

The underlying runner (`scripts/sdlc-runner.mjs`) also removes `.codex/unattended-mode` automatically on clean exit via its `removeUnattendedMode()` helper. `/end-loop` is the manual equivalent for mid-cycle stop, crash recovery, or "make sure it's off" idempotent invocations.
